2017-06-23 00:00:00,"Short-Seller Nailed Home Capital, Then Got Stung by Buffett","Marc Cohodes was having dinner Wednesday with a friend at the Slanted Door, an upscale Vietnamese restaurant on San Francisco’s Embarcadero, when he saw the news: Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. had just thrown a lifeline to Home Capital Group Inc.

“I said, ‘Boy, that’s interesting,”’ he remembers. “I’m surprised Berkshire Hathaway would show up in something like this.”

It was a mild reaction for an investor who’s shown time and again he’s got brass. More than anyone, Cohodes has tried to discredit Home Capital. A former hedge fund manager and veteran short seller, he began betting against the stock in 2014, publicizing his view that the Canadian mortgage provider had lax underwriting and poor management.

It didn’t take long for the wager to net returns. Two years ago, the company said it found fraudulent data in documents provided by partner brokers who submitted about C$2 billion in mortgages. The lender cut ties with them, prompting a lower profit forecast.

The troubles didn’t end there. The Ontario Securities Commission alleged in April that company executives had misled investors about the extent of the mortgage fraud. Clients began withdrawing funds from savings accounts. From its peak in 2014, Home Capital stock fell about 90 percent.

Cohodes seemed to be riding a wave of vindication. So many other investors piled into the trade that, at one point, almost two-thirds of Home Capital’s shares were sold short.

Stock Rebound

In recent weeks, though, things started to turn around. The stock began to climb on news of asset sales and partners willing to invest in the mortgage lender. The company and former executives settled the regulatory probe this month.

Then, late Wednesday, the bombshell: Berkshire agreed to take a 38 percent stake in the company for about C$400 million ($300 million) and provide a line of credit. Home Capital’s stock rocketed 27 percent on Thursday to C$19. The shares added another 43 cents as of 9:52 a.m. in Toronto.

“Partnering with an investor with the pedigree of Berkshire should go a long way in restoring confidence, particularly with depositors,” Dylan Steuart, an analyst at Industrial Alliance Securities Inc., said in a note Friday. “This transaction, combined with the recent settlement with the OSC, will likely lead to funding inflows as the smoke continues to clear.”

Few investors would want to be on the opposite side of such an economic force. But Cohodes isn’t backing down. He said he still thinks Home Capital’s stock could go to zero and that he continues to bet on a decline, though he won’t disclose the size of his wager.

“I may lose,” he said in a phone interview on Thursday, while pacing around his his chicken farm about an hour north of San Francisco. “It may go to C$20. It may go to C$30. But I’m in a whole lot higher. I’m willing to see more rounds.”

Desperate, Horrible

Cohodes says he takes comfort in the way the deal with Buffett was structured and believes there’s a scenario where both he and the billionaire can make money. In addition to getting discounted shares in Home Capital, Berkshire agreed to provide a C$2 billion credit line that will eventually carry a 9 percent interest rate, generating returns for Berkshire even if the lender’s shares slump. Cohodes sees the deal terms as a validation of his skepticism.

“This move shows how desperate this thing really is,” he said. “If it weren’t Warren Buffett’s name, it would be destroyed today, just absolutely destroyed, because it’s that horrible of a deal.”

Home Capital declined to comment about Cohodes, but said in its statement Wednesday that the Berkshire investment was a “very strong validation and endorsement.” In the same announcement, Buffett added that Home Capital was a good bet because of its “strong assets, its ability to originate and underwrite well-performing mortgages, and its leading position in a growing market sector.”

Buffett, 86, has spent decades building Berkshire’s reputation as a source of capital for troubled companies. During the 2008 financial crisis, he plowed billions into Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and General Electric Co. He also propped up Bank of America Corp. when that lender ran into trouble in 2011. In exchange for putting money and his reputation on the line, he’s negotiated preferential returns for Berkshire shareholders.

As with those previous deals, Berkshire moved quickly with Home Capital. For Cohodes, who’s spent years digging into the mortgage lender, that’s another sign that his thesis may still be right.

“I got the goods,” he said. “I’m not wrong just because he shows up.”"
2017-06-22 00:00:00,Buffett Follows Goldman Model in Bailout for Home Capital,"Warren Buffett has become the lender of last resort for Home Capital Group Inc. The billionaire investor agreed to buy shares at a deep discount and provide a fresh credit line for the Canadian mortgage company, tapping a formula he used to prop up lenders from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to Bank of America Corp.

Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. will buy a 38 percent stake for about C$400 million ($300 million) and provide a C$2 billion credit line with an interest rate of 9 percent to backstop the embattled Toronto-based lender, Home Capital said late Wednesday in a statement. The interest on the one-year loan would net Berkshire at least C$180 million if it’s fully tapped.

“While the terms of the new credit line with Berkshire Hathaway remain harsh, we believe the purpose of this loan is to motivate Home Capital’s management to bolster their own funding sources,"" said Hugo Chan, chief investment officer at Kingsferry Capital in Shanghai, which owns shares in Home Capital. “This again shows Mr. Buffett’s masterful capital allocation skills,"" said Chan, citing his investment motto: “be greedy when others are fearful.”

The financial backing from Buffett sent the stock higher Thursday, though it comes at a cost, in keeping with his past bailouts of financial firms. Buffett has buoyed some of the biggest U.S. corporations in times of trouble, including a combined $8 billion injection to prop up Goldman Sachs and General Electric Co. when credit markets froze during the 2008 financial crisis.

Berkshire’s purchase of $5 billion of Goldman Sachs preferred stock paid Buffett’s company an annual dividend of 10 percent, and the billionaire also got warrants he later used to get more than $2 billion of the bank’s shares in a cashless transaction.

Deal Discount

In the Home Capital deal, Buffett’s firm agreed to pay an average price of C$10 a share, a 33 percent discount to Wednesday’s closing price of C$14.94. Berkshire would become the largest shareholder in Home Capital, which has a market value of about C$1 billion.

Home Capital surged 27 percent to C$19 in Toronto on Thursday. That gives Buffett a 90 percent return on paper for the equity investment, assuming the deal goes through. Home Capital’s bonds recovered. Its 3.4 percent securities due December 2018 traded at 98.4 cents on the dollar, the highest since the end of April, according to Bloomberg data. The investment also sent the Canadian dollar higher and boosted shares in rival lenders including Equitable Group Inc.

“If you have the Warren Buffett seal of approval, people will take you more seriously than if you don’t,” said Meyer Shields, an analyst with Keefe, Bruyette and Woods. “So you sort of look beyond the settlement and say, ‘OK, what matters most now is that Warren Buffett trusts this company. And that in turn, allows Warren Buffett to get much better returns on capital than maybe some other lender would have been able to.”

The C$2 billion credit line is only marginally cheaper than the emergency credit provided by the Healthcare of Ontario Pension Plan, which company directors have termed as “costly.”

Under the new credit agreement, the interest rate on outstanding balances will fall to 9.5 percent, from 10 percent under the existing HOOPP line. The rate will drop to 9 percent after the initial investment is completed. The standby fee on undrawn funds will dip to 1.75 percent from the current 2.5 percent, then fall further to 1 percent. The credit line is for one year. Home Capital has drawn about C$1.65 billion from the HOOPP loan.

The investment “is a strong vote of confidence,” in the long-term value of the business, Brenda Eprile, Home Capital’s chairwoman, said in the statement.

New Terms

The move is the latest sign of a turnaround in the 30-year-old lender after a regulator in April accused it of misleading shareholders on mortgage fraud, which sent its shares tumbling, sparked deposit withdrawals and threatened to disrupt Canada’s real estate sector. Earlier this week, Home Capital agreed to sell a portfolio of commercial mortgages to affiliates of KingSett Capital Inc. for C$1.16 billion in cash.

“Home Capital’s strong assets, its ability to originate and underwrite well-performing mortgages, and its leading position in a growing market sector make this a very attractive investment,” Buffett said in the statement.

The share purchase will be done in two parts: an initial investment of C$153 million for about a 20 percent equity stake, then an additional investment of C$247 million taking the stake to about 38 percent. The second phase requires extra approvals.

Berkshire will not be granted any rights to nominate directors and has agreed to only vote shares representing 25 percent of the company’s stock, Home Capital said.

Home Capital shares have tripled since bottoming in May when its troubles began to accelerate, though remain about 73 percent down from their peak in 2014. The company last week took full responsibility over allegations the lender misled shareholders about mortgage fraud and agreed with three former executives to pay more than C$30 million to reach settlements with regulators and investors.

More Confidence

The most important market news of the day. Get our markets daily newsletter.

Home Capital directors said on a conference call Thursday the focus on the deal with Berkshire was to restore investor and capital markets confidence. The lender chose Buffett’s firm because the name would help restore confidence, even with the high price paid. There were about 70 parties looking at the company and its assets, and the board had several options in front of them including a sale of the entire firm, they said on the conference call.

“It’s actually quite brilliant on the part of Home Capital to have secured this deal,” said Michael Sprung of Toronto-based Sprung Investment Management. “It would have been a long, hard struggle without bringing in the backing of someone like Warren Buffett to rebuild this company and to reestablish the confidence of not only shareholders but depositors and mortgage brokers.”

On the executive search, Home Capital said they were making progress and hoped to announce a new chief executive officer in July.

Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is wading into a tense Canadian housing market, with Toronto house prices cooling after being hit with a 15 percent tax on foreign buyers and tighter mortgage regulations, and confidence shaken by the Home Capital drama. Meanwhile, prices are surging in Vancouver again after being sideswiped by similar policy moves."
2017-06-21 00:00:00,Japan's Stocks Decline as Falling Oil Drags on Energy Explorers,"Shares in Tokyo slipped, halting a three-day rally as crude oil declined and the yen gained against the greenback.

Oil tumbled into its first bear market in 10 months on Tuesday, pulling energy-related stocks down in Japan amid concerns unceasing production from U.S. shale fields is overwhelming OPEC efforts to ease a global supply glut. Banks and chemical products makers weighed the most on the benchmark Topix. Trading volume on the Topix was 12 percent below the 30-day average.

“Japanese stocks have risen for three days, and with the overseas environment a little weak, it’s easier for profit-taking to take the lead,” said Mitsuo Shimizu, deputy general manager at Japan Asia Securities in Tokyo. “It’s difficult to judge whether the oil drop is due to a slowdown in growth or if it’s merely a matter of oversupply.”

“Much of today’s decline is due to profit-taking” after the past few day’s gains, said Hitoshi Asaoka, a strategist at Asset Management One Co. in Tokyo. “Japanese stocks’ sense of cheaper valuation seems to be approaching its limit.”

2017-06-19 00:00:00,Rolls-Royce Weighs Tweaking Engine to Give a Lift to Airbus A380,"Eric Schulz, president of civil aerospace at Rolls-Royce Holdings PLC, discusses the market for the company's engines and technological improvements planned for their products. He speaks with Bloomberg's Guy Johnson from the Paris Air Show on 'Bloomberg Markets.' (Source: Bloomberg)

Rolls-Royce Holdings Plc is seeking ways to upgrade its engines for Airbus SE’s A380 as the planemaker attempts to win orders for the slow-selling superjumbo jet, the company’s biggest.

“We are contemplating what we can do over and above with Airbus,” Eric Schulz, Rolls-Royce’s head of civil aviation, said in a Bloomberg TV interview. “As soon as we mature a new technology we have a tendency to go back and roll it back to the product. We have done quite a lot of this already on the Trent 900.”

Exclusive insights on technology around the world. Get Fully Charged, from Bloomberg Technology.

Previous engine improvements have lifted fuel performance by as much as 1.5 percent with each package, Schulz said Monday at the Paris Air Show. He declined to predict further savings that a new upgrade might provide. In 2015, the London-based engine maker scooped up an order on 50 jets from the superjumbo’s biggest customer, Emirates, replacing a joint venture between General Electric Co. and the Pratt & Whitney unit of United Technologies Corp.

Airbus on Sunday announced plans to introduce a “plus” version of the A380 with aerodynamic changes, including the addition of winglets to improve fuel burn by 4 percent. The planemaker also is offering customers a reconfiguration that adds 80 passengers to the 550-seat aircraft.

“We have constant improvement on the engine, but now was the time to make an improvement through the aerodynamics,” Airbus Chief Executive Officer Tom Enders said in a separate interview. “There’s plenty of ideas, but that is something we discuss individually with the airlines.”

Airbus is in “ongoing discussion” with Emirates, Enders said. Bloomberg reported earlier this month that the carrier was in talks to purchase 20 more of the jet for its fleet. That would bring the Dubai carrier’s total orders for the four-engine behemoth to more than 160 aircraft.

The A380plus and upgrades being considered still fall well short of the so-called “neo” upgrade that Emirates has been demanding, but for which Airbus and Rolls-Royce say there isn’t a business justification."
2017-06-20 00:00:00,Robots Are Eating Money Managers’ Lunch,"Rishi Ganti used to help manage the personal fortunes of hedge fund founders David Siegel and John Overdeck, whose quantitatively driven strategies turned them into billionaires. Ganti, 45, says he’s glimpsed the future of his industry. A wave of coders writing self-teaching algorithms has descended on the financial world, and it doesn’t look good for most of the money managers who’ve long been envied for their multimillion-­dollar bonuses.

On a cold spring day, Ganti, clad in a gray hoodie, takes quick sips of Earl Grey tea at a bakery in Manhattan’s Tribeca neighborhood and explains that many of his peers don’t yet realize their careers won’t last. “Algorithms are coming for your job—they only ask for electricity,” says Ganti, jabbing his finger on a lime-green laminated table. “Algorithms are already reading, processing, and trading the news even before the photons have hit your retina.” Yet few money managers are alarmed by the threat. “They’re anesthetized,” Ganti says.

He started plotting out the impact of algorithms while working for Siegel and Overdeck at Two Sigma Investments, before striking out two years ago to start his own firm, Orthogon Partners Investment Management Co. To survive, Ganti says, money managers should look beyond the multitrillion-dollar stock exchanges, bond-trading platforms, and big deals backed by private equity and venture capital. To a greater or lesser extent, computers can see all those markets, assess how they’re performing, and start detecting patterns that could reveal profitable trading strategies.

Ganti’s answer is to look for what are known in the industry as esoteric assets—the most obscure stuff he can find. He’s arranged alternative funding for charter schools in the U.S. and paid cash upfront to collect judgments due at Brazil’s supreme court. His team also has purchased nonperforming loans at a discount in Portugal and partnered with local experts in Mexico to fund government infrastructure programs. It’s even provided interim financing for refugee camps in Italy. The point about these investments, he says, is that they require “high human capital” to manage, even if they’re plentiful. “It’s like dark matter,” Ganti says. “They dwarf the visible stuff lit up by markets.”

It’s not unusual to hear hedge fund managers argue that investors need to go off the beaten path to boost returns. What Ganti is saying is that money managers need to go there to save their own careers. He thinks that about 2 percent to 7 percent of the hedge fund industry’s $3 trillion of assets will jump every year from predominantly human oversight to computers.

Ganti, who earned his Ph.D. in economics at Harvard, concedes this is just his guesstimate, but there’s plenty of evidence of a trend gathering force. Funds that use algorithms for trading, according to Hedge Fund Research Inc., already account for almost a third of the industry’s assets. BlackRock Inc., the world’s biggest asset manager, is shifting some stock analysis to machines. Bridgewater Associates, Point72 Asset Management, and JPMorgan Chase are trying automation techniques. Then there’s the huge shift of assets to index funds, which can be thought of as a very simple but dirt-cheap and effective form of computerized investing. The problem for hedge fund managers is they cost so much, traditionally charging 2 percent of assets and taking a 20 percent cut of profits. “Those are vast sums of money for recognizing patterns,” Ganti says.

Ganti’s former boss Siegel said last year he’s “very worried” that machines could soon cost large swaths of the global workforce their jobs. Some economists think financial managers in general, unlike most other categories of workers, will be protected from automation. But the ones who make their living picking investments for clients and trading in the markets may be at risk, says David Autor, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who studies labor markets. “The distribution of rewards in finance will become even more skewed, with a small number of ‘superstars’ making huge sums, and much of the routine work done by machines,” he says. “With luck, the cost of financial services will come down. It’s not a great era in which to be a midlevel fund manager.”

It’s one thing to delve into esoteric markets to distinguish yourself from the quants. It’s quite another to do well—the assets are hard to value and risky by nature. Orthogon’s strategy, for example, includes scooping up receivables and other claims owed to those in need of immediate cash—a refugee facility waiting for payment on a contract from a charity, for example. Tod Trabocco, a managing director at Cambridge Associates LLC, a Boston-based firm that advises clients on investing, says fund managers have to research such assets carefully. “There’s the risk that a hospital, for instance, billed a government agency incorrectly and now is owed less,” he says. “Or a purchaser claims that it got a defective product and now doesn’t owe any money.”

The most important business stories of the day. Get Bloomberg's daily newsletter.

Orthogon, which runs $110 million and started investing in 2016, returned 5.4 percent in its first eight months and 5.6 percent this year through May, according to an investor document. At Two Sigma’s private proprietary investment group, which also managed employee money, Ganti’s wagers on esoteric assets returned an annual average of about 14 percent from September 2008 to December 2014, according to the investor document. Prior to Two Sigma, Ganti did stints at hedge fund HBK Capital Management and JPMorgan’s proprietary trading group.

“He’s smart, a little eccentric, and you can’t get further away from public markets and computers than what Rishi does,” says Paul Morelli, a managing partner at Vernal Point Advisors, which invests in Orthogon. Ganti says the demise of money managers won’t happen all at once—there are still bank tellers and candlemakers. He likens the process to a mountain surrounded by rising flood waters: The base is easily traded markets, such as stocks. Higher up are bonds and derivatives, then niche investments such as aircraft leasing, movie rights, and drug royalties, followed by human-heavy dealmaking such as mergers and buyouts. Esoteric assets are at the peak. “I’m surprised how slowly people are walking up the mountain instead of running,” he says. “They’re moving much too slowly.”"
2017-06-19 00:00:00,"Bombardier C Series Buoyed by Qatar Interest, GE's Canada Deal","Bombardier Inc.’s marquee C Series jet, which hasn’t won a major new contract in more than a year, got a boost from interest at Qatar Airways and Air Baltic Corp. and from a new jet-leasing venture between the planemaker’s largest outside shareholder and General Electric Co.

The single-aisle model could be suited to an Indian operation that Qatar Air has won permission to establish, the Persian Gulf carrier’s chief executive officer, Akbar Al Baker, said Monday at the Paris Air Show. AirBaltic said the first jets from an order for 20 CS300s have outperformed fuel-burn targets and confirmed it is progressing with an evaluation of the smaller CS100 variant.

“We’ve had several conversations with Akbar and he is watching the program,” Fred Cromer, president of Bombardier’s commercial aircraft unit, said in an interview at the expo. “His interest level increased when he was able to see the aircraft for the first time in Paris a couple of years ago.”

Qatar Air said in March that it aims to set up a short-haul airline in India with a fleet of 100 narrow-body planes as its renews a push to tap one of the world’s fastest-growing travel markets. That project remains on track, with the Doha-based company gaining the right to establish the unit when it is ready, Al Baker said.

The airline has come close to buying the C Series before, though it shelved those plans at the 2011 Paris Air Show.

Bombardier climbed 3.6 percent to C$2.56 at 1:55 p.m. in Toronto. The shares gained 14 percent this year through June 16 while Canada’s benchmark S&P/TSX Composite Index was little changed.

Positive Move

GE Capital Aviation Services, one of the world’s largest jet-leasing companies, said Monday that it would create a $2 billion financing platform with Caisse de Depot et Placement du Quebec, Canada’s second-largest pension-fund manager, to capitalize on global demand for commercial aircraft.

The move involving the Bombardier investor “may be be a positive” for the C Series, Cromer said, while declining to speculate further about the implications.

Bombardier is confident of winning more C Series orders this year. The company has delivered 14 of the aircraft to date. Certification to take off and land at London City airport -- which has a short runway unable to handle most jetliners -- has piqued the interest of carriers, while Riga, Latvia-based AirBaltic has reported strong performance data.

“I have CEOs coming up to me saying they’re hearing the aircraft is doing extremely well,” Cromer said. “The number and intensity of the conversations is increasing.” There was similar interest among airline executives at the International Air Transport Association annual meeting in Mexico this month, he said.

Embraer Contest

AirBaltic has improved fuel burn 21 percent from the five C Series planes it has received, compared with the Boeing Co. 737-300s that the model is replacing, the airline’s CEO, Martin Gauss, said at the air show. That’s compared with the promised 19 percent boost. Passenger feedback has focused on lower noise levels, a brighter interior and bigger spaces for stowing baggage, he said.

The carrier needs 14 planes to replace a fleet of Bombardier Q400 turboprops and is evaluating the CS100 against Embraer SA’s E195-E2 jet, which is set to enter service in the first half of 2018. An order decision could come later this year with deliveries starting in 2021, Gauss said in an interview.

Bombardier is also hopeful that existing customers will convert options they have for the C Series into firm orders, Cromer said. Lufthansa holds 30 such positions, while Korean Air Lines Co. President Walter Cho is talking about exercising 20 options beyond the 10 jets on order even before taking the first aircraft later this year."
2017-06-18 00:00:00,Taiwan Lays Plans for $59 Billion in Renewable-Energy Finance,"New energy, meet new finance. That’s the thinking of Taiwan’s government, which is starting to map out funding plans for a power system that can no longer rely on nuclear reactors.

Prime Minister Lin Chuan’s administration aims to increase the share of renewable energy such as water, wind and solar to 20 percent of total power output on the island by 2025, up from 5 percent currently. The Taiwan government hopes to attract NT$1.8 trillion ($59 billion) of private capital.

Developing funding channels will be critical, given the ambitious target. Bloomberg New Energy Finance, in a September assessment, said that Taiwan might only raise the share of renewable energy in electricity generation to 9.5 percent by 2025, in part because of the lack of a developed supply chain for the new sources of power.

Among the challenging targets for 2025 set by the island’s government:

Lower thermal coal’s share in electricity production to 30 percent from 45 percent

Eliminate nuclear power, which currently accounts for 14 percent

Raise the share of natural gas to 50 percent from 32 percent

To try and lure investment, authorities will guarantee purchases of the resulting electricity. Taiwan’s green finance is still at an early stage and there will be a lot of business opportunities, said Lin Chih-chi, director general of the department of planning at Financial Supervisory Commission.

Here’s Some of the Challenges:

The potential of green finance depends on government promotion, said Phoebe Li, vice president of Chinatrust Commercial Bank in Taipei Local banks, which lack experience financing green energy -- especially in wind power -- need to team up with foreign banks, she says

There’s steady growth in green loans every year, said Daniel Teng, chief executive officer of corporate banking at Cathay United Bank Valuation for wind deals is fairly difficult; Taiwan needs more talent and consultants in the area, he says Green finance deals were more profitable a few years ago; now there is more competition on pricing

Some local banks are quite conservative in lending, especially for offshore wind projects, Chen Chung-Hsien, a senior specialist at the Bureau of Energy in Taiwan’s Ministry of Economic Affairs, said in an interview with BNEF in February Local banks have more appetite for solar projects

said in an interview with BNEF in February

Taiwan is making some headway in the area of green bonds -- a type of security also being endorsed by Apple Inc. -- after rolling out rules for them in April. Four banks including E. Sun Commercial Bank, Chinatrust Commercial Bank, Bank SinoPac and KGI Bank have sold the first batch of green bonds. CPC Corporation, a petroleum and natural-gas refiner, is planning to issue green bonds by the end of this year. Credit Agricole CA also intends to sell green bonds in Taiwan, people familiar with the matter said in May."
2017-06-16 00:00:00,The Car Industry Is Losing Its Head Over Uber,"Though a student of philosophy, Sergio Marchionne gets right to the point when it comes to one of the big trends sweeping the auto business:

“Contrary to what some of my colleagues believe, we are not in the mobility business. We don’t move people around... At the end of the day, we are only building the tools that allow people to be mobile. I don’t want to buy into the distribution machine like GM did by paying $500 million for a 10-percent stake in Lyft.”

I disagree with the Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV boss about many things, but he's right to be dubious about his industry’s splashing of cash on ""mobility services"": a catch-all for stuff like ride-hailing and car-sharing. While the shift from combustion engine to electric vehicles is happening and autonomous driving will come too, in time, we’re a long way from automatic car capsules à la Minority Report.

The most important business stories of the day. Get Bloomberg's daily newsletter.

Yet carmakers have been at it again this week. Jaguar Land Rover disclosed a $25million investment in Lyft, while Daimler AG took part in a $500 million funding round for Careem, a Middle East ride-hailing service. Toyota Motor Corp. last year handed an undisclosed sum to Uber Technologies Inc., while Volkswagen AG ploughed $300 million into Gett, an Uber rival. There are plenty of other projects.

You could argue that these investments might give carmakers access to a new sales channel, by leasing cars to Uber drivers for example. Plus they're a hedge against people dropping car ownership entirely.

Still, Uber’s governance meltdown is a reminder of ride-hailing's immaturity as a business. The company lost almost $3 billion last year. Peugeot and Daimler, among others, earned record profits as U.S., U.K. and Chinese car sales hit fresh highs.

Regardless, many carmakers have convinced themselves that making vehicles is no longer enough. In their rush to ""mobility"" they're chucking around money, hoping something sticks. Bernstein analyst Max Warburton says Ford Motor Co's ambitions to make 20 percent margins in mobility services are ""patently nonsense"". Yet he worries that ""strategies are anchored on this stuff"".

In fairness, it’s not surprising carmakers feel under pressure. Most trade on anemic earnings multiples. Even BMW’s market capitalization is smaller than Uber's purported value. The recent ousting of Ford CEO Mark Fields shows what happens if executives move too slowly.

Still, corporate boards are in danger of ignoring history. As Fiat chairman and Agnelli family heir John Elkann has pointed out, back in 1999 Ford had hopes of tripling its price-earnings ratio from 10 to 30 times by becoming a consumer products and services company invested in Hertz, satellite radio and Kwik Fit. Today, its forward PE is 7 times. Fiat made similar expensive mistakes in so-called ""value chain extension"" too, but it seems to remember them better than some rivals.

Ford’s chief problem now is weakening U.S. sales, not a failure to match Uber. Ford makes most of its profit from trucks, so arguably it would be better focusing on that, not shared shuttle-van services.

The industry has enough challenges without frittering away cash on nice-to-have services for pampered city-dwellers. As a consumer, I’m delighted BMW and Daimler have parked hundreds of vehicles around my home town (Berlin) for when I can’t face cramming myself onto a subway carriage. But is it a money-spinner for shareholders? Almost certainly not.

Amid all the mobility hullabaloo, remember Uber doesn’t sell cars and neither does Alphabet Inc. or Apple Inc.

2017-06-16 00:00:00,The $31 Billion Hole in GE’s Balance Sheet That Keeps Growing,"It’s a problem that Jeffrey Immelt largely ignored as he tried to appease General Electric Co.’s most vocal shareholders.

But it might end up being one of the costliest for John Flannery, GE’s newly anointed CEO, to fix.

At $31 billion, GE’s pension shortfall is the biggest among S&P 500 companies and 50 percent greater than any other corporation in the U.S. It’s a deficit that has swelled in recent years as Immelt spent more than $45 billion on share buybacks to win over Wall Street and pacify activists like Nelson Peltz.

Part of it has to do with the paltry returns that have plagued pensions across corporate America as ultralow interest rates prevailed in the aftermath of the financial crisis. But perhaps more importantly, GE’s dilemma underscores deeper concerns about modern capitalism’s all-consuming focus on immediate results, which some suggest is short-sighted and could ultimately leave everyone -- including shareholders themselves -- worse off.

“It’s a clear tension,” said Olivia Mitchell, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School and executive director of the Pension Research Council. “Buybacks clearly use assets available not to fund the pension promise but to make shareholders happy.”

In GE’s case, lavish shareholder rewards failed to deliver outsize returns and left Flannery with less room to maneuver. Not only must he boost profits, shore up its cash flow and contend with its flagging oil services and transportation businesses, but the 30-year GE veteran also needs to pay close to $50 billion in pension obligations that come due in the next decade.

‘Significant Decline’

“Given the significant decline in interest rates and volatile financial markets that resulted in lower asset returns from 2008 to 2009, the company has been actively managing the pension liability,” said GE spokeswoman Jennifer Erickson. In 2017 and 2018, the Boston-based company plans to contribute a total of $3 billion to its pension, she said. GE’s primary plan covers about 467,000 people and is one of the biggest in the U.S.

Nobody is suggesting that GE is in imminent danger of defaulting on its pension obligations and many analysts say the company still has years to address the bulk of its shortfall. What’s more, a rising rate environment helps GE winnow its pension deficit by boosting its expected return.

But if nothing else, balancing the competing interests of its shareholders and employees has proven to be especially hard for GE. Immelt began ramping up GE’s buybacks in 2015, shortly after Peltz’s Trian Fund Management took a stake in the industrial giant and recommended that the company step up the repurchases to boost its stock price. GE bought back about $23 billion that year and then $22 billion in 2016. Last year’s total was more than double the amount GE spent in 2013, data compiled by Bloomberg show.

Wider Shortfall

Yet in the last two years, GE spent little more than $2 billion on total pension contributions, which hasn’t been nearly enough to keep the overall shortfall from widening. (The company also curtailed capital investments.) At the end of last year, its pension had $94 billion in obligations but only $63 billion in assets -- a funding ratio of 67 percent.

“GE has the tension between financialization and innovation,” said William Lazonick, a professor of economics at the University of Massachusetts Lowell. “People at the top are living in fear of hedge fund activists and worry about their share price rather than what is going on with the company.”

To make matters worse, GE shares have still underperformed even with the buybacks -- though capital allocation was a factor in management bonuses last year. Since October 2015, when Peltz first disclosed his position in GE, the stock has returned 20 percent, less than half the gain for industrial companies in the S&P 500.

The financial consequences of GE’s short-termism have been considerable. In addition to the “anemic” free cash flow from its industrial businesses, GE’s pension hole and its indebtedness helped subtract roughly $8 a share from its equity value, based on a sum-of-the-parts analysis by Cowen & Co. That’s equal to $70 billion in market capitalization. To put it another way, the discount amounts to eight years of per-share earnings based on 2016 results.

Hard Choices

Those problems “prevent Mr. Immelt or his successor, Mr. Flannery, from dramatically transforming the portfolio,” according to Cowen, which released its report on June 12, the day that GE announced Flannery would succeed Immelt as chief executive officer.

When it comes to dealing with GE’s pension, Flannery may have few good options. While many other companies, including General Motors Co., have offloaded some of their obligations to insurers, it could come at a considerable cost because of how big and underfunded GE’s pension has become. The company has the largest projected benefit obligation of any S&P 500 member and among the top 10, no one has a lower funding ratio.

And the longer its pension remains underfunded, the costlier it becomes. The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp., a government agency that acts as a backstop when plans fail, has more than tripled its rates for companies with funding deficits, and they’re set to rise even more in the next two years.

Depending on the circumstances, “it may be more advantageous to lower what you pay for the premiums than buy back stock,” said Michael Moran, chief pension strategist at Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s asset manager.

‘Risky Strategy’

Your cheat sheet on life, in one weekly email. Get our weekly Game Plan newsletter.

Because interest rates are still relatively low, it’s possible for GE to borrow money it needs to cover its shortfall. Verizon Communications Inc. and FedEx Corp. sold bonds this year to do just that. But according to Cowen, GE may be constrained in how much more debt it can take on because it’s already on the hook for about $130 billion. Debt in the industrial units is lower, though, at about $20.5 billion.

If GE is able to fully fund its pension with debt, there’s no guarantee it won’t fall behind again. Investing in safe, low-yielding bonds might not be enough for GE to earn the 7.5 percent return that it expects for its pension assets each year and pay for the debt that it incurs. Taking on more risk could leave its pension vulnerable to another market downturn.

“This would be quite a risky strategy,” Mitchell said. “Any unpleasant investment surprises would leave the pension even worse-funded than now.”

If GE meets its expected return on assets and costs remain relatively similar to last year, the company’s plan to contribute more than $1 billion this year should help chip away at the shortfall, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

Earning enough will be crucial. Even though GE ended its defined benefit plans for new hires in 2012, the company still needs to pay out roughly $47 billion in pension benefits to its retired employees and their beneficiaries over the next 10 years, a regulatory filing showed. That’s half its total obligations.

It wasn’t supposed to be this way. According to Dennis Rocheleau, a 36-year GE veteran who was its chief labor negotiator until 2004, the company considered its pension well prepared and thought its investing prowess could help keep the plan in shape. No one could foresee the financial crisis or the rock-bottom rates that followed.

Competing Priorities

We were “smug about our position,” said Rocheleau, who has spearheaded an effort opposing GE’s decision to reduce some health benefits for retirees.

What Flannery will do now is anyone’s guess. And truth be told, GE’s employees have a stake in seeing the company’s stock rise because the pension trust itself owned about 32.9 million GE shares at the end of last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

During a conference call to discuss the CEO transition and his priorities, Flannery said that “it is important that we’re always mindful of the impact on all of our stakeholders.”

“So, obviously, our customers, our employees,” he explained before adding, “but I’d say, especially our shareholders.”"
2017-06-15 00:00:00,"From GE to HNA, Feeling the Urge to Merge, De-Merge and Re-Merge","No one would confuse Adam Tan with Jack Welch.

Welch, of course, shot to fame by turning General Electric Co. into a model of late-20th century American capitalism, a sprawling industrial conglomerate with a high-octane financial arm bigger than most banks.

Jack Welch Photographer: Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg

Tan, by contrast, runs HNA Group Co., a private giant in China that, outside business circles, is virtually unknown in the U.S.

But Tan is, in fact, something of a Welch fan -- which might seem surprising, given that Welch’s empire-building strategy has fallen out of favor as his successor, Jeffrey Immelt, spent the past 16 years dismantling the House That Jack Built.

Now, a new leader at GE, John Flannery, will have to decide if America’s quintessential conglomerate can really shrink its way back into investors’ hearts. Some analysts wonder if GE might spin off its health business. Others hypothesize about a wholesale breakup.

For a radio report on Flannery’s promotion, click here.

Thing is, conglomerates have been going in and out of fashion since the 1960s and, depending where you are, still are.

As GE enters its next era, and diversified U.S. companies such as Honeywell International Inc. confront calls to slim down, some multi-industry giants elsewhere are charting courses more akin to Welch’s than Immelt’s.

Adam Tan Photographer: Christopher Goodney/Bloomberg

Take HNA, which started out as a small airline. Immelt undid Welch’s dramatic expansion into financial services. But Tan, in an interview with Bloomberg this month, laid out global ambitions that, a la Welch, include a deep push into financial services.

“We tried to learn from GE for many, many years,” Tan said. “Now we’ve built our own empire, but our teacher’s disappeared.”

Across the globe, there are still companies trying to prove that the diversified model can work. In India, the sprawling Tata Group has built one of the world’s largest conglomerates, with businesses ranging from salt to steel, refrigerators to tea, drugs to luxury cars. Tata has more than two dozen publicly listed entities.

Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim’s Grupo Carso SAB runs enchilada-serving restaurants, an offshore drilling rig and automotive-cable production.

So where does all of this leave GE and its new chief executive?

In the U.S. stock market, at least, multi-industry companies are starkly out of favor. Pressured by activist shareholders that want to see stock prices go up, companies such as Dow Chemical Co. and DuPont Co. are planning to split up into three companies following their merger, while Honeywell is reviewing its portfolio amid calls from hedge-fund gadfly Dan Loeb to break apart.

John Flannery Photographer: Prashanth Vishwanathan/Bloomberg

Nelson Peltz’s Trian Fund Management, the activist investor that took a stake in GE in 2015, has called recently for operational changes such as cost cuts to juice results and boost shareholder value. The firm said it’s keeping management accountable, even if it hasn’t called publicly for a breakup.

Flannery plans to review GE’s portfolio and has said everything is on the table. Some speculate more big changes are coming.

“He gave himself plenty of breathing room before he has to start opining on the priorities and the portfolio and what it means to be a conglomerate,” said Deane Dray, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets. “There’s an underlying trend across the sector that is relentless, and it’s this pendulum that’s swinging toward the urge to de-merge.”

With $120 billion in sales last year, GE is smaller than it was when Immelt assumed the CEO role in 2001, even after making acquisitions to build out the power, oil and health-care divisions. Internally, executives have championed a “simplification” initiative.

But the stock is down 9.2 percent this year to $28.69 after underperforming the markets last year, and Flannery has acknowledged that it’s an issue.

One option: a breakup. Julian Mitchell, an analyst with Credit Suisse, puts the total value of GE’s parts at $34 a share.

“There appears to be a general view that spinoffs work, even if the company that spins off an asset was not viewed as particularly undervalued in the first place,” Mitchell said in a June 12 note. GE may consider separating into two businesses-- utility power and transport -- and divesting the remaining units, he said.

Flannery, for his part, said he would consider all options, even a sale of the health-care unit that he has run since 2014. But he has so far rejected the idea that conglomerates are just plain bad for shareholders.

“The focus of investors is the output, not necessarily the construction of the company,” Flannery said in an interview this week. “They want growth, they want visibility, they want predictability, they want margin rate. That is what drives them.”"
2017-06-12 00:00:00,GE's Immelt to Receive at Least $112 Million as CEO Steps Down,"Jeffrey Immelt, who is stepping down as chairman and chief executive of General Electric Co. after 16 years, will retire with at least $112 million, mostly from supplemental pension plans at the industrial giant.

Immelt, 61, had amassed $81.7 million in overall pension benefits as of Dec. 31, according to the Boston-based company’s proxy filing dated March 8. He also will receive at least $20.7 million from early vesting of restricted stock and pro-rated portions of his target performance shares, based on GE’s closing price Friday, as well as $9.86 million from deferred compensation plans.

Two company-paid life insurance plans for Immelt also provide a combined death benefit of $24.2 million.

Immelt is leaving after months of stepped-up pressure from activist investor Trian Fund Management, which called on GE to improve performance and cut costs more aggressively as shares missed out on a broad stock rally. John Flannery, a 30-year GE veteran who currently heads up the health-care business, will take over as CEO on Aug. 1, the company said Monday in a statement."
2017-06-13 00:00:00,GE Unveils Big Data Tools for Industry Amid Software Shift,"General Electric Co. is unveiling software for boosting its machines’ productivity and streamlining repairs, alongside deals with Danish shipping line Maersk Corp. and French energy producer Dalkia SA.

GE announced new software for power plants, drilling platforms and wind farms at an event in Berlin Tuesday. The showcase for GE’s IT know-how comes a day after the Boston industrial giant said longtime Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey Immelt would step down Aug. 1 in favor of health-care chief John Flannery, after a transition to ""a high-tech industrial company"" that’s increasingly selling software in addition to heavy gear.

Immelt, CEO since 2001, built up GE’s capabilities in outfitting its turbines, jet engines, wind farms and medical equipment with data-collecting sensors and a software platform called Predix to analyze it all.

The software push by GE is part of a broad movement by industrial producers to create factories, energy plants and vehicles that can sense their own performance and surroundings, cut costs or create new businesses based on that data. Competitors including Germany’s Siemens AG, Switzerland’s ABB Ltd. and France’s Schneider Electric have also been adding software and data-analysis capabilities to their machinery.

Technology companies including IBM, Google, Microsoft, and Amazon.com are also applying their software to manufacturing and transportation applications, opening new rivalries.

GE has about 20,000 software engineers working on its software in the energy, aviation, healthcare equipment, and oil and gas industries. Instead of simply trying to sell service contracts with an offshore wind turbine for example, GE can now offer customers a digital model of the turbines it sells so their buyers can manage fleets based on location, performance, and weather conditions, Mark Hutchinson, GE’s CEO for Europe, said in a recent interview.

Bill Ruh, the CEO of GE Digital, the company’s software and industrial internet division, said digitizing industrial operations would constitute a $200 billion market by 2020. “As the price of their product declines, companies are looking for efficiency,” he said in an interview.

GE doesn’t plan to scale back its software push under its new CEO, vice chair Beth Comstock said in Berlin.

""Investors have been patient,"" she said in a meeting with reporters. ""They’ve been with us the last six years as we’ve been making investments.""

""I don’t know how you don’t go digital as an industrial company,"" she said. ""John Flannery knows this first hand. He’s very aware of what’s happening in other businesses. He’s not in isolation.""

GE plans later this year to introduce a combination of its software tools for monitoring machines’ performance with the ServiceMax field service software it acquired this year. GE Ventures, the company’s investment and intellectual property licensing arm, is launching a company called Avitas Systems to combine GE’s Predix platform with data analysis, robotics and AI technology for inspecting machines in the drilling, energy and transportation industries.

Maersk Drilling and GE have started a year-long pilot to increase a drilling platform’s productivity by monitoring machinery on board and predicting its maintenance schedule. GE will also work with Dalkia to predict gas engine repair schedules.

GE is estimating $1 billion in Predix orders this year, and Ruh said he’s seeing more ""intensity of demand"" in Europe” compared with other regions. In Germany especially a set of government programs and private investment, known as Industry 4.0, is attempting to speed up investments in digitizing production.

GE last year spent $4 billion to develop its analytical software and another $2 billion on industrial 3-D printing acquisitions and development."
2017-06-11 00:00:00,These Are the Corporate Winners and Losers of the Qatar Standoff,"With Qatar increasingly isolated from its Gulf neighbors in an escalating geopolitical crisis, the economic and financial implications are starting to emerge.

The country — which has been accused of supporting Islamist militant groups by Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt — relies on other Gulf states for about 20 percent of its imports and almost half of its tourists, according to Dubai-based Arqaam Capital Ltd. Billions of dollars of infrastructure projects are also at stake as it prepares to host the 2022 soccer World Cup.

“We expect the move to cut diplomatic ties with Qatar could have significant economic ramifications for its economy, but to have barely an effect on the rest of the GCC,” said Arqaam’s head of equity research Jaap Meijer. “We expect consumer prices in Qatar to be affected first, though economic growth and government projects should also be affected.”

Here’s a look at how the crisis could impact companies in the region:

Banking

Foreign deposits — especially from the six-nation GCC — that have helped sustain institutions like Qatar National Bank QPSC and Commercial Bank QSC are at risk. Qatar’s domestic banking system relies heavily on foreign cash. Non-resident deposits made up 24 percent of deposits in the country’s 18 lenders in April, according to the central bank. That compares with 1.2 percent in Saudi Arabia and 12 percent in the U.A.E.

Potential Losers: QNB, the Middle East’s largest lender, traded last week at the cheapest valuation to global peers since 2013 based on price-to-estimated future earnings. “QNB is heavily reliant on foreign funding and is highly exposed to GCC and Egyptian markets,” said Aarthi Chandrasekaran, vice-president for research at Shuaa Capital PSC in Dubai. “We would refrain from Qatari banks in general, despite a sharp correction in recent times.”

The U.A.E.’s biggest lenders, First Abu Dhabi Bank PJSC and Emirates NBD PJSC, could “experience a slowdown in business coming from Qatar,” according to Mena Corp. “The impact could affect deposits and loans as Qatari based clients might withdraw cash to avoid uncertainties arising from governmental decisions on freezing accounts and so forth,” the Dubai-based brokerage said.

Energy and Utilities

Possible Winners: Qatar Electricity & Water could be “the one Qatar stock portfolio investors see as the safer position than others,” said Sanyalak Manibhandu, head of research at NBAD Securities LLC. Shares fell 9 percent last week.

The diplomatic dispute could give U.S. natural gas exporters a stronger foothold in the global market. Tankers carrying liquefied natural gas from Qatar have been diverted after the blockade. Unlike many LNG cargoes, U.S. supplies aren’t restricted by contract to specific destinations, making American exports a flexible source of the fuel. As tensions mount, U.S. shippers could see higher demand for abundant supplies from America’s shale reservoirs.

Potential Loser: Abu Dhabi’s Dolphin Energy, which supplies the U.A.E. and Oman with about two billion cubic feet of Qatari natural gas per day via a 364-kilometer undersea pipeline, is still operating despite diplomatic tensions. A potential shutdown of the pipeline would cause a “severe problem” in the U.A.E. as demand for electricity peaks in the summer, according to Robin Mills, head of Dubai-based consultant Qamar Energy.

Food

Possible Winner: Qatar is in talks with Iran, Turkey and other countries to secure food and water supplies. “The potential impact on foodmakers’ shares is dependent on the type of the food they may get,” said Toygun Onaran, head of research at Oyak Securities in Istanbul. “Banvit, Pinar Et Un and Pinar Sut are likely to benefit should it be dairy, poultry or meat.”

Potential Losers: Dubai-based Al Khaleej Sugar Co., the world’s largest port-based sugar refinery, is the U.A.E.’s only sugar refinery, according to S&P Global Platts. Saudi Arabia and the U.A.E. have stopped exporting white sugar to Qatar, ADM Investor Services International said in a report. India and European countries will be quick to meet Qatar’s sugar needs, according to Yves El Mallat, chief executive officer of Bahrain’s Arabian Sugar Co.

Riyadh-based dairy producer Almarai Co. relies on its Gulf neighbors for more than a quarter of its revenue, though the share from Qatar isn’t known. Shares fell the most in eight months on June 5 when the crisis started. The stock, which has since recovered slightly, will likely rebound faster than its peers because its business is well diversified regionally, said NBAD’s Manibhandu.

Ulker Biskuvi Sanayi AS, Turkey’s largest producer of confectionery and snacks, has an 11 percent share of Egypt’s biscuit business and an 18 percent share in Saudi Arabia. “The sentiment soured around Ulker with the rift in the Gulf as the company has operations and plans to expand,” said Behlul Katas, an analyst at Istanbul-based Deniz Invest. Shares declined 6.5 percent last week.

Transport

Possible Winners: Gulf Air and Singapore Airlines Ltd, which compete with Qatar Airways on its top routes, are the main carriers that stand to benefit. “If we also take into account the possible negative branding impact across all GCC carriers, then the real beneficiaries are Singapore Air, Lufthansa and the key local airlines from top routes such as Malaysia Airlines, Philippine Airlines, Thai and Sri Lankan,” said Diogenis Papiomytis, director of aerospace at Frost & Sullivan. Other airlines on these routes such as Kuwait Airways, Saudia and Air France-KLM are also likely to see increased demand

Omani and Iranian ports could stand to benefit, according to Neil Davidson, senior analyst at Drewry Shipping Consultants Holdings Ltd. Existing container trade to Qatar mostly goes through the U.A.E. and Saudi Arabia. The alternative could be operating feeder vessels from hub ports in countries that aren’t part of the boycott. Kuwaiti ports are also an option but would result in a big diversion.

Potential Losers: State-owned Qatar Airways is set to be one of the biggest losers of the crisis. It operates 52 daily flights to the four Arab countries, according to data from scheduling firm OAG. About 30 percent of the carrier’s revenue could be affected, said Frost & Sullivan’s Papiomytis. The network impact is huge; the financial impact depends on the length of closures, he said.

U.A.E. national carriers Etihad Airways and Emirates can potentially benefit in the short term as they pick up displaced traffic from Qatar Airways' network. In the long term however, this is outweighed by the negative impact, analysts say. Gulf countries are expected to see a drop in business travel, which will affect premium bookings and fares across the region. Qatar Airways is likely to intensify its discount fares to ensure stable cash flow, which will impact the fares of airlines in the region. The perceived geopolitical instability and bad publicity will have a negative impact on the global brand of Gulf carriers.

Construction and Real Estate

The most important business stories of the day. Get Bloomberg's daily newsletter.

Potential Losers: Dubai-based contractor Drake & Scull International PJSC, which has shed more than 10 percent of its market value this year, has about 500 million dirhams ($136 million) of projects in Qatar, according to Majd Dola, senior research analyst at Al Ramz Capital. It has a 343 million dirham contract to build the first phase of the Doha Metro, due to be completed by 2020, according to Mena Corp.

The U.A.E.’s Arabtec Holding PJSC has two joint-venture projects in Qatar, pending legal cases and receivables, Dola said. “It’s very hard to quantify the direct impact on those companies, however it’s not going to be positive in the short-term,” he said. Shares are down 41 percent this year.

Developer Damac Properties Dubai Co. last month started construction of a 31-story luxury residential tower. It’s also developing two other high-rise buildings in the country. Still, just 0.5 percent of Damac’s revenue comes from outside the U.A.E., it said in its first-quarter earnings.

Media and Entertainment

Possible Winner: Qatari-owned phone carrier Ooredoo QSC earned only 6.6 percent of its revenue from GCC countries last year. Shares declined 6.1 percent last week, but fundamentals are not seen changing in the short run and the recent selloff could present a tactical buying opportunity, according to Arqaam Capital.

Potential Loser: Dubai-based theme park operator DXB Entertainment has Qatar Investment Authority as its second-biggest shareholder. The company “might face some further pressure if things as moved further in the negative direction,” said Al Ramz’s Dola. The company’s expansion plans, including those into Qatar, may also face challenges amid rising instability in the Middle East.

2017-06-09 00:00:00,Macron Seeking Stiff Carbon Costs to Avert Climate Change,"Emmanuel Macron reached out to Germany to establish a common price floor for carbon dioxide emitted by power utilities as the French president seeks to strengthen his alliance with Angela Merkel after the U.S. decided to exit the Paris climate accord, according to people familiar with the matter.

Macron wants to revive a plan to set up a minimum price of 30 euros ($33.55) per ton of CO2 emissions, about six times the current European level, a French official said, asking not to be named as the matter isn’t yet public. France is seeking to convince Germany and other European countries to adopt a similar plan, the person said. It would also make sense for countries such as Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg, said another person who has heard about Macron’s initiative.

Merkel and Macron Photographer: Krisztian Bocsi/Bloomberg

Merkel and Macron have been leading the international opposition to the disruptive presidency of Donald Trump in the U.S. rallying support for trade and climate action. Macron this week launched an appeal to U.S. environmentalists to come work in France, while Merkel is in Latin America preparing for another meeting with Trump at the Group of 20 summit in Hamburg.

The U.S. decision to exit the Paris climate accord comes after the price of European carbon permits plunged from their 2008 peak, eroding the penalty for burning coal, the most polluting fuel. Companies from Electricite de France SA to Engie SA have lobbied for a minimum price of at least 30 euros, arguing it would boost the use of cleaner natural gas-fired power stations.

Hard Sell

Spokesmen at Germany’s Environment Ministry weren’t immediately available for comment. Messages seeking comment from the French president’s office weren’t immediately replied to.

The proposal may be a hard sell in the short term for German Chancellor Merkel, who faces general elections in September. A floor price for carbon emissions might hurt German utilities RWE AG and Uniper SE, which have said it would lead to job losses because they rely heavily on lignite and coal to produce electricity.

France unsuccessfully tried to convince Germany to adopt a common carbon floor price last year in a bid to supplement the EU’s Emissions Trading System, which has failed to provide an efficient incentive to reduce greenhouse gases. A glut of pollution rights pushed prices in the $48 billion market down more than 80 percent since 2008.

France then considered introducing a floor price unilaterally last year before dropping the plan a few months before this year’s presidential elections amid labor union protests that it would prompt coal-fired plant closures.

The French and German leaders plan to hold a joint cabinet meeting over the summer.

Generating Revenue

The most important business stories of the day. Get Bloomberg's daily newsletter.

A tax on carbon would generate government receipts, which could be used to mitigate the “social impacts” of the energy transition on the coal industry, EDF Chief Executive Officer Jean-Bernard Levy said Thursday at a conference in Paris organized by the Toulouse School of Economics. By introducing a levy of 18 pounds ($22.88) per ton of CO2 emissions, the U.K. has cut the share of coal in electricity production to 10 percent from 30 percent in two years, he said.

“The time is the right one today for an initiative that maybe could be generated in France, with quick support of Germany, obviously after the September elections,” Levy said. “It can be done gradually, and it can be done in such a way that it leads to no massive phasing out of production means in the short term.”"
2017-06-08 00:00:00,China's Clean Energy Ambition Floats on Abandoned Coal Mine,"China’s ambitions to dominate new energy technologies are unfolding at the site of an abandoned coal mine about 300 miles (483 kilometers) northwest of Shanghai.

There, in Anhui province, Sungrow Power Supply Co. has built the world’s largest floating solar farm with 166,000 panels on a lake created when a nearby mine collapsed. While not an entirely unique idea -- similar facilities are working in Japan, the U.K. and Israel -- the project’s scale represents a step forward for China in shaping the future of energy.

President Xi Jinping’s government this week is drawing attention to those efforts at a meeting of energy ministers from around the world that concludes Thursday in Beijing. With plans to spend $360 billion on renewable energy by 2020, China is seeking to appear as a global leader on the environment, marking a contrast with U.S. President Donald Trump’s rebuke of the Paris Agreement on climate change.

“The Chinese are really investing in the research and development side of innovation,” said Helen Clarkson, chief executive officer of The Climate Group, a non-governmental organization that works to promote clean energy technologies and policy.

While Trump has said repeatedly he wants to stimulate fossil fuels and especially coal, China is funding a series of ground-breaking projects that generate power without pollution. Whether with massive floating solar farms like the one in Anhui, sprawling wind farms or ambitious plans to develop geothermal reserves, the world’s most-populous nation is asserting itself as a powerhouse of clean-energy technology.

Renewables Spending

In the northwestern province of Qinghai, Huanghe Hydropower Development Co. is planning a demonstration project to integrate power from hydro-electric dams with wind turbines and solar cells. Similarly, the Guoshen Group, a power plant operator, intends to build a project that will combine wind, solar and thermal power with energy storage in the northern region of Inner Mongolia.

Meanwhile, construction has begun on China’s first large-scale effort to trap and store carbon dioxide emissions. The Yanchang Integrated Carbon Capture and Storage Project, Asia’s first commercial carbon capture plant, is set to begin operating in 2018.

“Everybody has to become more sophisticated about their investment strategy,” said Sophie Lu, head of China research at Bloomberg New Energy Finance. “Now it’s all about innovation either in new technology or in a new application or a new business model.”

China’s efforts pit it against the U.S., which insists it can remain a hotbed of innovation in energy even though the president is slashing funds for start-ups in the industry and pulling out of the 2015 Paris accord. On his trip to Asia to represent Trump, U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry spoke forcefully of America’s efforts to spur energy technology while also challenging China to take leadership on the issue.

“There is a lot of innovation out there, and it is gonna come, not all of the ways, but a lot of it will come from the United States,” Perry told reporters in Tokyo. “Somehow or another, because we don’t belong to this little club, you can’t be innovative and drive technology and affect the climate. I just don’t buy it.”

Jobs Growth

The stakes are high for both nations. The clean-energy business employed 9.8 million people last year, up 1.1 percent from 2015, led by an expansion in solar photovoltaics, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency’s annual report. Green jobs may reach 24 million worldwide in 2030 as more countries work to combat climate change, Irena said.

“China is a real driver in the money they invest in the diligence of their innovation,” California Governor Jerry Brown said in a Bloomberg Television interview on Tuesday. “I want California to partner with China in that endeavor. Otherwise we won’t achieve our climate goals.”

In Anhui, Sungrow’s 40-megawatt solar farm in a district of Huainan city called Panji features panels fixed to floats on the surface of a lake that formed after the ground surrounding an old coal mine collapsed.

Hong Kong-listed Xinyi Solar Holdings Ltd. completed a 20-megawatt floating solar farm last year in Huainan. On a reservoir outside Tokyo, Kyocera TCL Solar LLC has finished a 13.4-megawatt project, the biggest of its kind in Japan. Thames Water Utilities Ltd., the U.K.’s largest privately owned water supplier, operates Europe’s largest floating solar farm on its Queen Elizabeth Reservoir reservoir near Heathrow airport.

By the end of September, Sungrow will complete more than 150 megawatts of new floating capacity in Huainan, said Hu Bing, an executive at Sungrow, the world’s second-biggest photovoltaic inverter maker.

The Anhui project could yield 5 percent to 10 percent more power compared with a conventional solar plant because the panels are expected to be cooled as surface water evaporates, said Hu.

To be fair, China’s energy innovations still have some way to go to catch up to the country’s aspirations.

While China has 37 working nuclear reactors, none have been built without expertise from abroad. The country also hasn’t produced an innovator with a profile similar to that of Tesla Inc., General Electric Co. or Vestas Wind Systems A/S.

The U.S. plans to keep its competitive edge “the same way we have historically,” Perry said in Tokyo. “It’s called innovation and technology.”

2017-06-01 00:00:00,Trump's Toughest Climate Foe Taking Clean-Air Crusade to China,"With President Donald Trump’s withdrawal from the Paris climate pact, the leader of the U.S. state with the strictest clean-car rules is turning toward Beijing in his longtime mission to stem automotive pollution.

California Governor Jerry Brown departs Friday for China, where he’ll urge the world’s most populous country and largest car market to take environmental cues from Sacramento, not the U.S. capital. Brown -- an anti-smog crusader since a previous term as governor starting in 1975 -- is now 79 with less than two years left to serve. His gambit in China could create an environmental legacy beyond what he could hope to accomplish in California itself.

“There’s so much propaganda and outright climate denial in Washington,” Brown, a Democrat who attempted runs at the U.S. presidency in three different decades, said in an interview last week. The trip to China is a way “to forge agreements that will counteract the misguided Republican efforts in Washington.”

Trump’s decision to dump the Paris accord, announced Thursday at the White House, is “an insane move,” Brown said on a conference call shortly afterward. “California will resist.”

In China, Brown will spread the gospel of California’s auto policies, including a state rule requiring an increase in annual sales of zero-emission vehicles powered by batteries or hydrogen. The Chinese government is weighing a similar requirement for automakers competing in the world’s largest vehicle market.

Standards Review

It’s a different story in Washington, where the Trump administration is revisiting stringent vehicle greenhouse gas and fuel mileage standards for 2022-2025 following pleas from the auto industry. The rules, enacted by Trump predecessor Barack Obama, would boost the fuel economy of new cars and light trucks to an average of about 50.8 miles per gallon by 2025, up from 30.3 mpg this year.

The pullout from the Paris accord, which Trump called a “massive redistribution of United States wealth,” won’t have a direct effect on the reexamination of the automotive standards. The decision leaves the tailpipe and fuel economy regulations as the lone Obama-era climate initiative that remains largely intact and creates a leadership void that China appears ready to fill.

“China has been working very hard to try and replace the U.S. as the world leader in a number of areas,” said Yunshi Wang, director of the China Center for Energy and Transportation. Trump’s abandonment of the Paris accord, Wang said, “is obviously a big opportunity from the Chinese perspective.”

Chinese Rules

The most important business stories of the day. Get Bloomberg's daily newsletter.

Under rules that could be implemented next year, a manufacturer selling 100,000 cars and trucks in China would need to sell about 2,500 battery-powered vehicles with a 200-mile range, said Wang, whose center is part of the Institute of Transportation Studies at the University of California Davis. Other compliance options include buying credits from competitors -- as with the California rules that China is using as a model -- or reducing sales of gasoline-powered cars, he said. California is also helping China develop a cap-and-trade system to limit carbon dioxide emissions from heavy industry and other sectors of the economy.

Zero-emission vehicles could help China with its national-security interest in reducing oil imports, Wang said. In addition, Chinese automakers now see ZEVs as a chance to finally export large numbers of cars and trucks.

“It is good industrial logic to develop products in and for the largest market,” said Bill Russo, managing director of Gao Feng Advisory Co. and a former head of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV’s Chrysler unit in China. “The U.S. move, together with China’s push, will serve to put China in the position to lead the commercialization of new energy vehicle technologies.”

Some automakers are pressing the government for more time to meet the targets, Wang said. But they also appreciate California’s involvement, since it provides a legal template that they themselves helped developed through long years of legal sparring with the state’s Air Resources Board. Mary Nichols, the board’s chairperson, is scheduled to join Brown on the week-long trip.

Plug-In Vehicles

Volkswagen AG aims to sell 1.5 million units of zero-emission or plug-in cars in China by 2025 with most of them locally produced, while General Motors Co. is targeting 150,000 units in the same time frame under its Buick, Chevrolet and Cadillac brands.

Wang predicted that by 2025, 10 percent to 20 percent of China’s vehicle sales could come from battery-powered cars or plug-in hybrids. Last year, Chinese consumers purchased 507,000 such vehicles, or more than three times as many as in the U.S.

“China is the world’s largest single market for electric vehicles today,” said Roland Hwang, director of the transportation program at the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental advocacy group. A California-like electric car sales mandate “in China will kick the whole global electric vehicle market into even higher gear,” he said.

‘Remain Vigilant’

Brown has vowed to fight attempts by the Trump administration to undermine the state’s stringent auto rules and to go to court if there’s a challenge to California’s 47-year-old permission to enact clean-air rules that are tougher than U.S. standards.

In the interview, Brown accused the U.S. auto industry of backing Trump, saying it hasn’t changed much since General Motors claimed in 1973 that it would go bankrupt if California forced the installation of catalytic converters.

“The leopard is not going to change its spots,” Brown said. “We have to remain vigilant.”

In separate statements, GM and Ford Motor Co. signaled that the Paris withdrawal may do little to sway their plans for current and future electric vehicles. Though neither addressed The pullout directly, Ford said climate change is real and GM said “international agreements aside, we remain committed to creating a better environment.”

Brown’s opposition to Trump’s policies could have political ramifications at home. “Climate change could be a unifying issue that pulls the Democratic Party together if the 2018 midterm elections become a referendum on Trump,’’ said Alan Baum, an independent auto analyst in Bloomfield Township, Michigan."
2017-05-25 00:00:00,Ford’s New Outsider CEO Has Some Catching Up to Do,"Even as the long bull run in global car sales begins to wane, no one can deny that the past few years have been good times for most automobile makers. Freer-spending consumers and demand for SUVs in North America and China helped drive the industry to a seventh consecutive year of record global sales in 2016. General Motors Co.—less than a decade after it exited bankruptcy—and Daimler AG logged the best earnings in their histories last year. Even shareholders of onetime laggard Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV got a boost from the improved environment, with its stock cranking out a total return of about 80 percent from late 2014 to May 19.

Yet despite remaining solidly profitable, Ford Motor Co. hasn’t exactly been running in high gear. The No. 2 U.S. automaker’s shares fell 32 percent in the three years ended May 19, dropping the company’s market value to below that of upstart electric vehicle maker Tesla Inc. Ford last fall received a public tongue-lashing from Donald Trump over its plans to move some small-car production to Mexico and ultimately canceled plans to build a factory there. Its 2016 earnings sank 38 percent. And in mid-May the company announced a program to cut 1,400 salaried employees in a bid to show investors that it’s controlling costs.

The weight of all that news came tumbling down on Chief Executive Officer Mark Fields, who led the company during the big stock slide. On May 19, Fields was ousted by Executive Chairman Bill Ford because of the disappointing results and a view that the company needs to increase efforts to keep pace as the industry is transformed by electric vehicles, driverless cars, and both ride-hailing and ridesharing services that could result in fewer sales in the not-too-distant future.

“We need to speed up our decision-making, we need to invest our capital where we can create value, and we have to move decisively to address underperforming areas,” says Bill Ford.

He’s given the task of remaking the company for the digital age to Jim Hackett, a 62-year-old outsider who spent most of his career running a furniture business. Yet the former CEO of Steelcase Inc. has a reputation as a persuasive visionary who’s comfortable in the high-tech world—and who’s also willing to take a scalpel to a workforce. In his 20 years as Steelcase’s CEO, Hackett cut 12,000 jobs and shifted the company from simply making furniture to reenvisioning how people work. He’s widely credited with remaking the dreary office cubicle. Now, after three years on Ford’s board and a year running its tech-driven Smart Mobility unit, he’s responsible for leading the automaker through the same kind of cultural revolution.

“Jim took a company that defined itself as a furniture maker, and said, ‘Let’s imagine the future of the workplace, let’s build our company around that,’ ” says Bill Ford. “Of course they still make furniture, but in doing so he grew the company and took them to first in the industry.”

Hackett will need all his powers of persuasion to convince commuters that Ford has a better idea for self-driving cars and ridesharing than the Silicon Valley crowd. Both Wall Street and many consumers are increasingly enamored with Tesla’s vision of electricity as the clean power source of future vehicles. Yet besting buzz-driven Tesla isn’t the only challenge in EVs. GM already has a long-range electric vehicle on the market—the Chevy Bolt, which debuted last year—and Ford is still years away from fielding a similar car.

Likewise in ride hailing, Uber Technologies Inc. is far bigger and more global than Ford’s own Chariot shared-van service, which plans to operate in only 11 cities by yearend. GM last year invested $500 million for a 9 percent stake in Lyft Inc., the No. 2 ride-hailing service in the U.S. And in autonomous vehicles, Ford says it won’t have a fully driverless vehicle on the road until 2021, but Waymo, Google’s driverless technology unit, is already letting the public sign up to use its autonomous hybrid Chrysler Pacifica minivans.

In an era when emerging markets—especially China—have become the holy land for GM and big foreign manufacturers such as Volkswagen AG and BMW, North America accounted for about 66 percent of Ford’s first-quarter revenue. While GM has exited five underperforming markets since 2015, Ford has been slower to pull the plug. The automaker’s South American region, for instance, has operated at a loss for 14 consecutive quarters, racking up $3.4 billion in red ink since the first quarter of 2013.

While Hackett cautions that it’s too soon to discuss specific changes, he says he’s not afraid to shake things up. “I’ve made it clear to everyone that everything is on the table in terms of what do we need to get to where Bill and I and the board believe we need to be,” he says.

Holes in the company’s lineup are one thing that will likely command his attention early on. Despite sport utility vehicles and truck models being in greater demand in the U.S. for years, the company didn’t announce until January that it would revive the Ranger midsize pickup and Bronco SUV models. Dealers will have to wait until 2020 for both to be in the lineup.

Ford’s profits have been suffering relative to GM’s because the company hasn’t invested as much in larger SUVs, says Eric Noble, president of consultant CarLab. GM dominates the market with models including the Cadillac Escalade, Chevrolet Tahoe, and Suburban. “They have given up tremendous market share almost exclusively to GM,” says Noble, who estimates GM makes about $20,000 apiece in profit on its big SUVs. Ford’s “neglect” of the Expedition and Lincoln Navigator, which are being redesigned this year, is “almost unforgivable at a time when SUVs are selling so well.”

Where Ford still rules is in trucks. Its F-Series pickup is the company’s top-selling model, accounting for about 40 percent of its U.S. revenue as calculated using base-level prices, Bloomberg Intelligence estimates. And with an average sale price of more than $48,000 per vehicle, the F-Series likely accounts for an even bigger share of the automaker’s profits, especially since some of Ford’s small-car models are believed to be barely profitable. Still, Hackett won’t say whether jettisoning small vehicles is in the cards. “Getting out is a big choice,” he says. “So I would tell you [I’m] not ready to make that decision today.”

Fields came under pressure from Ford’s board in May before an annual shareholder meeting, where investors excoriated management for a poorly performing stock price. Hackett has a reputation for acting quickly and a strong relationship with Bill Ford, who was impressed with him during a trip they took to Silicon Valley last year. The executive chairman’s family exerts power through a special class of stock and is involved in the company’s public communications, so the support of the namesake family is key for a Ford CEO.

That’s a similarity between Ford and Hackett’s previous employer, Steelcase. At the furniture maker, the descendants of the founding families still have representatives on the board and control a majority of the voting rights. At Ford the family has 40 percent voting control, with two members sitting on the board.

“You actually can have no more committed shareholders because these folks put most of their net worth in the business,” Hackett says of the familial nature of both boards. “Their interests are so aligned with everybody else. So I love that.”

The bottom line: Ford, whose shareholders missed out on much of the recent good times for automakers, is turning to an outsider as CEO."
2017-05-25 00:00:00,"Asia Bulls Take Note, This Japan Fund Likes Brazil, Ghana","The fund is keeping exposure in Brazil after political crisis

Amid all the talk of Asia’s allure within emerging markets, one of Japan’s top-performing fixed-income funds is finding value elsewhere.

The most important market news of the day. Get our markets daily newsletter.

T&D Asset Management Co.’s Nomura emerging-market bond fund has returned 14.5 percent this year, beating 98 percent of its peers, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The fund, also managed by Capital Guardian Trust Co., is currently betting more on debt of countries including Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Ghana and Kenya, while being underweight notes issued by Asian countries, says Yuichi Onsen, T&D Asset’s chief strategist and general manager of global fixed-income investment department in Tokyo.

“Economic fundamentals for each of those nations are looking solid,” Onsen said. “On the other hand, this fund is underweight in Asia because if you look at the real interest rates, they are not so attractive any more.”

T&D Asset’s fund -- a so-called double decker or layered fund -- invests mainly in dollar bonds of emerging economies and then converts the dollar holdings into the Mexican peso.

Onsen shared his views with Bloomberg in phone interviews this month:

Why are Latin America and Africa attractive?

“At this point, there’s probably no change in the view toward Brazil and our fund’s exposure to the nation after the news,” Onsen said, referring to the latest political crisis in the country.

political crisis in the country. In Brazil, inflation has been contained and interest rates have dropped, and yet, the rates are relatively higher, making them more attractive.

“While the emerging-market economies have been stabilizing in general, Mexico has been promoting some reforms in sectors such as telecom and energy, and looking at how the trade negotiations on Nafta are going, it may actually come out with new agreements” favorable to Mexico.

In Africa, infrastructure and industrial development has been going on, in addition to their natural resources industries. There’s IMF-led progress in Ghana, and -- for example -- an increase in electricity supply contributes to the slowdown in inflation, which is a positive.

The fund will probably continue its overweight positions in Latin America and Africa.

Many investors are bullish in Asia, but why are you underweight?

The fund is underweight in Asia, with almost no exposure to China.

“The fund doesn’t have exposure to China because while there’s concerns about the economy, the real interest rate that takes account of inflation is not attractive. We have acknowledged risks of some bad news like this for China,” Onsen said, referring to Wednesday’s debt-rating downgrade by Moody’s Investors Service.

downgrade by Moody’s Investors Service. “Asia is underweight as the region’s bonds look to be already expensive, while there are not many economies that offer attractive real yields.”

Among Asian economies, the fund holds an overweight position in Indonesia due to stabilizing inflation and improvements in exports.

What is your investment strategy going forward?

The fund currently has half of the excess returns from currencies, when compared against an index it uses as a reference.

The dollar seems to be peaking out, so the ratio of local currency holdings may rise to 15-20 percent from the current 10 percent.

What has contributed to the performances of the fund this year?

A sharp rebound in the Mexican peso has contributed to the overall performance.

“The appreciation of the Russian ruble has also contributed significantly to the returns from the currency positions, although the currency is now looking a bit expensive.”

What is your outlook on the Mexican peso?"
2017-05-24 00:00:00,Is the Land of the Rising Sun Finally Rising Again?,"Japan isn’t exactly the most obvious place to open a family theme park. Over the past six years, as the country’s epic demographic crisis has intensified, the number of children has plunged by 1 million. Yet on April 1 hundreds of fidgety kids and their dutiful parents withstood spring showers to attend the grand opening of the world’s newest Legoland.

Illustrator: Matt Chase

As you’d expect, the $380 million-plus project—built on former industrial land in Nagoya, Japan’s third-largest metropolis—possesses the requisite miniature town assembled from Lego bricks, not to mention amusement rides and water slides. What’s more surprising is when, during a visit, Nick Varney, chief executive officer of Legoland theme park developer Merlin Entertainments Plc, calls Japan “one of our three big growth ­markets”—the other two being the U.S. and China.

Wait, Japan? A growth market? Isn’t this the same Japan where unrelenting demographic trends and stifling economic stagnation have conspired to create the infamous Land of the Lost Decades? Where the failure to achieve a 2 percent inflation target is as predictable as spring cherry blossoms?

Indeed, it is—and indicators that inflation-obsessed investors might have overlooked seem to support Varney’s optimism. The country’s nominal gross domestic product, the calculation that reflects actual yen generated at today’s prices, last year saw its first record high since the 1990s. And corporate profits have hit an all-time high. Lending growth is trending at its strongest since before Japan’s property bubble burst. The unemployment rate is just 2.8 percent, the lowest since 1994. Wages may not be soaring, but they’ve risen more than 1 percent for four straight years—the best streak since the early ’90s—and they jumped 2.2 percent last year. The International Monetary Fund’s medium-term inflation outlook is now 1.6 percent, vs. less than 1 percent in 2012.

Prime Minister Shinzo Abe would be the first to claim ­credit for putting the economy on a more positive trajectory, and his revamp of the Bank of Japan has played a crucial part. The central bank has pumped massive liquidity for four years now, helping to produce a more competitive exchange rate and to pull down borrowing costs. But Abe has also benefited from some lucky timing. His December 2012 election, for example, coincided with the end of multiple blows to the economy: the early ’90s bubble collapse, the late ’90s Asian financial crisis, an early 2000s bad loan shakeout, and the 2008 global meltdown. Japan’s economy is “not about to grow 4 percent,” says Peter Tasker, who oversees hedge funds at Arcus Investment Ltd. after a career in research at securities firms in Tokyo, “but it can do better than the past two decades, and it can be a successful economy on its own terms.”

Tasker speaks as someone who first planted his feet in Japan in the ’70s, a time when fortunes in his home country (the U.K.) were fading and those of Japan were on the rise. He remembers fondly the bygone era of rapid growth. His take on the ’80s bubble years? “Hell, yeah, that was fun,” he says. Tragically, it was based on “the Godzilla of real estate bubbles,” and inept responses from bureaucrats and bankers to the collapse in asset prices left the economy adrift for decades. But since Abe took office, the political and economic ­dynamics have changed dramatically, says Tasker, who sees the country as “much more stable.”

While Abe’s record isn’t flawless—a 2014 sales tax rise triggered a recession, and he’s made little progress on job market deregulation—he and his team have had some quality wins besides BOJ stimulus. An initiative to boost the role of women in the workforce has paid off—they account for the vast majority of job gains in recent years. Another achievement: making companies more responsive to shareholders. Dividend increases and share buybacks are at unprecedented levels, asset managers are on the hunt as never before for companies with sleepy boardrooms ripe for shaking up, and investor-relations departments are no longer an oddity.

“This is a much different environment for us as investors,” says Tasker, who regularly meets with representatives of firms that his fund has stakes in. “The idea that there should be a relationship between companies and investors—that wasn’t the case in the ’80s and ’90s.” What it all means for stocks is that Japan is now “in the group of markets that are investable,” he says.

However, positive indicators can’t hide the fact that Japan’s consumption and investment growth rates remain below those of other developed nations. Politicians talk about continuing to battle a “deflationary mindset.” And there’s still the world record level of public debt, more than double the GDP. Above all, many Japan watchers emphasize policymakers’ consistent failure to achieve that 2 percent inflation target. (The last reading, in March, was a paltry 0.2 percent.) But some investors say that’s too narrow a framework. And prices could turn around quickly, if the shrinking supply of labor causes wage gains to ­accelerate.

Uchida Co., an auto parts molds supplier to Honda Motor Co. founded in 1955, has endured tough times in recent years brought on by Japan’s economic malaise. Executive Managing Director Takumi Tanaka, the company’s No. 2 official, maintains a downbeat attitude. He counts himself as a skeptic of Abenomics from the start, saying in mid-2013 that conditions were even worse than during the post-Lehman ­Brothers global financial crisis. Four years on, he remains dismissive. “The benefits of Abenomics? Where are they?” he asks, complaining about the length of time it takes to win approval for government subsidies. “We have to find our own way to survive.”

And Uchida has survived. Although it lost a factory to Japan’s devastating 2011 tsunami and continues to endure pressure from its customers, revenue is projected to rise by one-third this year compared with 2012. Tanaka credits his company’s success to technological advances, including 300 million yen ($2.6 million) in machinery investment over the past two years. Uchida is ­investing another 300 million yen in the fiscal year starting in June. And it’s added 10 full-time employees since the 2011 quake, bringing the payroll to 105 people. “We just have to keep trying and investing in technology in order to make business in Japan,” Tanaka says.

Bigger fish, too, are thriving, despite Japan’s challenging fundamentals. East Japan Railway Co., the country’s largest passenger rail operator, has warned for years that a falling population would undermine its long-term business. Yet JR East, as it’s known, has seen its revenue climb to record levels. As with Uchida, investment is one reason—a bigger network for its bullet trains has boosted sales. New lines from Tokyo to the Sea of Japan and the northern island of Hokkaido have led to a “big increase” in travel, according to the company’s president, Tetsuro Tomita. “There’s also been a significant impact from inbound tourism,” he told reporters at an April briefing. “We’re working to take better advantage of it to increase sales.”

Tourism numbers have soared so high that the Abe administration had to reset its targets. Some 24 million visitors arrived in Japan in 2016, blowing through Abe’s original goal of 20 million by 2020, the year Tokyo will host the Summer Olympics. Hotel ­investment is booming to accommodate the influx, and local communities are vying to offer their particular attractions—world-class skiing in Nagano, swimming with dolphins off Miyake Island, hiking near volcanoes on the southern island of Kyushu. “Japan’s tourism industry is on the verge of becoming a major economic engine for the country,” analysts at McKinsey & Co. wrote in an October report. A swelling middle class in emerging-market Asian economies including China and Thailand has propelled the boom, with fellow Asians lured by Japan’s reputation for customer service, food quality, efficient transportation networks, and beautiful scenery.

There’s plenty of room for growth: Tourist receipts amount to just 0.6 percent of GDP, less than half the U.S. ratio and little more than one quarter of France’s, according to 2015 World Bank data, the latest available.

One thing Japan seemingly can’t escape is population ­decline, and its enduring opposition to large-scale immigration means the number of workers is bound to plummet. But there’s a new dynamic that can help it manage that process: automation. Abe’s government calls it “the robot revolution.” Two of the world’s top-four industrial robot makers, Fanuc Corp. and Yaskawa Electric Corp., are based in Japan, and when it comes to services, the potential for growth is seen as enormous. The development and deployment of ­robots and artificial intelligence is projected to save 5.7 million Japanese jobs through March 2031, according to an economy ministry estimate.

Abe, who’s scheduled to stay in power at least until late 2018 (and potentially through 2021, assuming his party wins the next election), continues to pursue reforms, including a recalibration of trade policy now that President Trump has pulled out of the regional Trans-Pacific Partnership. “There’s been far more success for the overall Abenomics agenda than generally recognized,” says Jonathan Garner, chief Asia and emerging—­markets equity strategist at Morgan Stanley in Hong Kong, who has Japan as one of his top market picks. He anticipates both nominal growth and wages to strengthen further, finally spurring inflation—“the last piece of the jigsaw puzzle to fall into place.”

So is it morning in Japan again? That would probably be overstating things. “I’ve never come across a country which talks itself down as much as Japan,” says Varney, the Legoland developer. “It’s still a remarkable success story.”

So, finally, the sun may have at least stopped setting.—With Yuki Hagiwara, Chris Cooper, and Henry Hoenig

2017-05-22 00:00:00,Billionaire's Dream of Supersonic Luxury Jet Gets Assist From GE,"Billionaire Robert Bass’s dream of building a private supersonic jet is poised to get a boost from one of the world’s top engine makers: General Electric Co.

Aerion Corp. is in talks with GE to power what could be the first nonmilitary plane to fly faster than the speed of sound since Concorde flights were halted in 2003, according to a statement Monday by the Bass-backed aircraft start-up.

The most important business stories of the day. Get Bloomberg's daily newsletter.

The discussions represent a step toward resolving a major obstacle to Aerion’s plan for a jet that could shave three hours off trans-Atlantic trips -- and shorten flights across the Pacific by six. Aerion, which already has a committed buyer for its AS2 plane, has been working with the engine manufacturers to meet noise restrictions and fly economically at speeds both slower and faster than the sound barrier.

“The two companies will continue to participate in a formal and gated process to define a potential collaboration for an AS2 engine,” GE and Aerion said in a statement Monday. GE makes jet engines for large commercial aircraft producers, including Boeing Co. and Airbus SE planes.

Aerion’s effort to build a supersonic business jet gained momentum in 2014 when Airbus agreed to help design and produce the plane. The following year Flexjet, a fractional-jet ownership company, placed an order for 20 AS2 aircraft.

GE said a final agreement hasn’t been reached. “We welcome their vision and are excited to continue discussions on engine configuration,” said Brad Mottier, GE’s vice president for business aviation.

Speed of Sound

Aerion envisions a plane that will fly at a top speed of Mach 1.5, or 1.5 times the speed of sound, over water while staying just under the sound barrier when over land to avoid sonic booms. Backlash against the booms and engine noise eventually killed flights by the Concorde, which first went into service in 1976.

Aerion’s challenge is to sell enough of the AS2 aircraft to offset the investment required to develop costly components, with the engine being the most expensive. The list price of the plane is $120 million.

Aerion began working on the plane in 2003 only to see its plans interrupted by the 2008-2009 recession, which caused demand for corporate jets to plummet. Last year, business-jet shipments were 657, more than 40 percent lower than the peak of 1,136 in 2008, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.

2017-05-22 00:00:00,GE Faces Probe for Misleading EU Over $1.7 Billion Deal,"General Electric Co. is the latest U.S. company to be investigated by European Union for possibly turning in misleading information during a merger review.

The European Commission opened proceedings on March 9 to review whether GE misled EU officials examining a deal to buy LM Wind Power, a maker of wind-turbine blades, for 1.5 billion euros ($1.7 billion), the Boston-based company said in an emailed statement on Monday.

Since then, there has been “no further formal communication” from the commission to GE and the EU regulator cleared the deal on March 20, GE said. The probe is at a preliminary stage, according to a person familiar with the matter.

GE may be in trouble for telling regulators it didn’t have any plans to develop a new giant offshore wind turbine when the company did have such a project on hold, said another person, who asked not to be named as the case is confidential. GE is now scrambling to explain that there was no intention to misinform regulators, the person said.

EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager signaled a zero tolerance approach to companies that give inaccurate information when she fined Facebook Inc. 110 million euros on May 18 for combining WhatsApp data with its other services after having told the merger officials otherwise during the EU’s 2014 review. The social network said it acted in good faith and won a lower fine after cooperating with regulators.

‘No Excuse’

“It’s no excuse that the closed circle of people working on a merger didn’t know what was going on elsewhere at the company,” Vestager told Bloomberg on May 19 in a general response to questions about the EU’s crackdown on merger cases. “That simply doesn’t hold up,” she said, adding that companies “need to be thorough.”

If the EU considers it has enough evidence against GE, the next procedural step would be to state its case in a so-called statement of objections, which could take months to be put together. Such documents are often a precursor to fines. The European Commission in Brussels both declined to comment on the GE probe.

GE’s push into the wind industry comes after the Boston-based firm took over Alstom Renewable Power Sector as part of its $10 billion acquisition of Alstom SA’s power operations two years ago. GE renamed the unit, which produces 6MW offshore wind turbines, GE Renewable Energy.

On March 20, the EU approved GE’s acquisition of Denmark-based LM Wind Power unconditionally after officials found no competition concerns.

But while GE told the commission during the review that it wasn’t planning to expand into next-generation offshore wind turbines with a capacity of 12MW, EU regulators subsequently said they found evidence to the contrary, the second person said. The punishment for breaking the EU’s rules is as high as 1 percent of their annual sales.

The probe into possible misleading information may lead to a statement of objections around the EU’s summer break in August and subsequent fines, the person said.

In addition to any fine, the case could hurt GE’s relationship with EU regulators as they review its other merger plans and investigate its maintenance contracts for aircraft engines. Last month, GE filed for EU approval its plan to combine its oil and gas business with Baker Hughes Inc."
2017-05-20 00:00:00,Blackstone Unveils $100 Billion Ambition for Infrastructure,"Blackstone Group LP, the world’s biggest private equity manager, is eyeing more than $100 billion in infrastructure investments with a new strategy anchored by Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund.

PIF agreed to commit $20 billion to the pool, and Blackstone plans to raise the same amount from other investors, the New York-based asset manager said in a statement Saturday. With leverage, Blackstone expects to have more than $100 billion in purchasing power for infrastructure projects, primarily in the U.S.

The agreement between Blackstone and PIF is a non-binding memorandum of understanding, and the organizations are continuing to negotiate terms, they said.

The partnership comes as top executives, including Blackstone Chief Executive Officer Steve Schwarzman and KKR & Co. co-CEO Henry Kravis, descend on Riyadh for the inaugural Saudi-U.S. CEO Forum, a weekend of dealmaking. The meetings, which have already yielded billions of dollars in deals between companies including oil giant Saudi Aramco and General Electric Co., are taking place as U.S. President Donald Trump visits the kingdom.

Infrastructure investing has gained renewed attention as Trump’s administration vows to direct more private money toward improving roads, bridges and airports. The asset class also fits the bill for liability-driven investors in the U.S. and abroad seeking current income amid near-zero interest rates and negative yields elsewhere in fixed income.

Urgent Needs

“There is broad agreement that the United States urgently needs to invest in its rapidly aging infrastructure,” Blackstone President Tony James said in the statement. “This will create well-paying American jobs and will lay the foundation for stronger long-term economic growth.”

Schwarzman is a top confidant to Trump from outside the White House. After he was elected, Trump asked the Blackstone billionaire to form a group of business executives that would meet frequently with the president to discuss job creation and economic growth. Schwarzman, 70, chairs the gatherings of the Strategic and Policy Forum.

Investor interest is fueling ever-larger pools of capital devoted to infrastructure. Brookfield Asset Management Inc. scored $14 billion last year for a pool dedicated to the strategy, which was topped in January by Global Infrastructure Partners, which closed on $15.8 billion.

Blackstone signaled its ambitions for a large fund in January, when its global head of private equity described what it would take to be a meaningful investor in infrastructure.

“To be relevant in that end of the market I think you need to be deploying billions of dollars at a time, not hundreds of millions, and so you’re probably talking about a vehicle that’s $20 billion, $30 billion, $40 billion dollars of equity,” Joe Baratta said then in an interview on Bloomberg Television.

Public Partnerships

Despite the buzz surrounding infrastructure, it’s not always an easy place for private investors to deploy their money. Lengthy planning and permitting processes can limit projects that are ready for investment, and not all projects generate attractive returns. Apollo Global Management LLC co-Founder Josh Harris said earlier this month that public-private partnerships, governments’ typical ploy for attracting private investment, often produce low returns that are hard to justify.

“In infrastructure we need revenues,” Harris said during the Milken Institute Global Conference in Beverly Hills, California. “There’s a lot of financing, but no revenues.”

Private investors therefore have to pick their spots carefully, finding projects that have different levers to pull. Airports are a key area of focus for providers of private capital, according to Glenn Youngkin, the president of Carlyle Group LP, which is raising money for a global infrastructure fund.

“Airports, right out of the box, is the No. 1 target area right now,” Youngkin said Friday on CNBC. “They are an understood commercial entity, and there are airports starting to move this way” already.

Oaktree, Stonepeak

Oaktree Capital Group LLC is marketing two infrastructure funds, one focused on U.S. transportation and another for North American energy, the firm said last month. KKR is planning to raise money for a third infrastructure fund, the private equity firm said last month, after raising $3.1 billion for its current pool in 2015.

EQT Partners in February finished raising 4 billion euros ($4.2 billion), almost 40 percent more than targeted, after less than six months for its third infrastructure fund. Stonepeak Infrastructure Partners, run by former Blackstone dealmakers, is targeting $5 billion for its third pool, people with knowledge of the matter said last month.

2017-05-20 00:00:00,Saudi Arabia Welcomes Trump With Billions of Dollars of Deals,"Saudi Arabia greeted U.S. President Donald Trump with agreements for deals worth hundreds of billions of dollars on Saturday as he embarked on his first state visit to the kingdom, which is undertaking unprecedented economic reforms.

The Public Investment Fund, the kingdom’s sovereign wealth fund, agreed to commit $20 billion to an infrastructure investment fund with Blackstone Group LP. The fund will eventually double in size with money raised “from other investors.” Saudi Aramco said it signed 16 accords with 11 companies valued at about $50 billion. One initial deal -- worth $15 billion -- was signed with General Electric Co. The U.S. and Saudi Defense Ministry also negotiated a package of about $110 billion, according to a White House transcript on Friday.

“I can’t imagine another business day that’s been as good for the United States and for the kingdom,” Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in the Saudi capital, dismissing concern that controversy engulfing Trump’s administration at home would impact his first overseas trip as president.

Saudi Arabia, the world’s biggest oil exporter, is eager to reset relations with the new administration after feeling shunned by President Barack Obama, who crafted the 2015 nuclear deal with their Shiite rival Iran. The kingdom is also embarking on plans to diversify its economy away from oil -- including the sale of a stake in Aramco -- after crude prices slumped by half over the past three years.

Corporate Titans

Officials gave varying figures for the total value of deals signed. Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir said the agreements were valued at more than $380 billion, $30 billion more than what was announced by Secretary of State Rex Tillerson in the same news conference. Earlier in the day, Saudi Cabinet Minister Mohammed Alsheikh put the total at about $300 billion.

Honeywell International Inc., Nabors Industries Ltd., Exxon Mobil Corp. and Lockheed Martin Corp. were among other U.S. companies to sign accords Saturday after American corporate titans met local business heads in Riyadh.

“Many of us sitting at the table are overseeing substantial investments in the United States,” Energy Minister Khalid Al-Falih said on a panel at the inaugural Saudi-U.S. CEO Forum that included Saudi billionaire Lubna Al-Olayan and Finance Minister Mohammed Al-Jadaan.

SoftBank Group Corp. and Saudi Arabia formally announced the first round of capital commitments for the largest-ever technology investment fund. More than $93 billion has been secured from backers led by the Japanese company and the PIF, SoftBank said in a statement Saturday. Abu Dhabi’s Mubadala Investment Co., Apple Inc., Qualcomm Inc., Foxconn Technology Group and Sharp Corp. are also investing.

Yasir Alrumayyan, managing director of Saudi Arabia’s PIF, said the fund will help his country’s strategy of developing “a diversified, knowledge-based economy.”

Raytheon Co. will cooperate with Saudi Arabia Military Industries on defense-related projects and technology development. It will establish Raytheon Arabia in Riyadh, the company said in a statement. Saudi Arabia Military Industries was set up this month to help reduce reliance on foreign purchases and to diversify the economy away from oil.

Trump’s eight-day trip will also take him to Israel and Europe. Leaders and representatives from 54 Arab and Muslim countries will also be present during his two-day stay in the kingdom, a close U.S. ally."
2017-05-19 00:00:00,Cadillac Creeps Up on Tesla With a Plush Plug-In,"Cadillac, it turns out, does a great Tesla impression—for about 30 miles at least.

That’s roughly when the battery runs dry on its new CT6 hybrid sedan. For the next 400 miles, the stately vehicle uses gasoline to mimic a BMW, which isn’t a bad thing at all.

As the auto industry’s luxury giants slowly turn their big guns toward Elon Musk and his factories in Nevada and California, they are launching a wave of machines to weaken his defenses. Cadillac’s new hybrid joins a growing field of plug-in leviathans, including BMW’s 740e, the S550e from Mercedes, and the Porsche Panamera 4 E-Hybrid.

Make no mistake: With all-electric ranges below 40 miles, these are in a different class than Tesla. They are more like the Toyota Prius, albeit with far more opulent fixings and much better performance.

I was 20 miles north of Cadillac’s Manhattan nerve center before I started burning prehistoric plankton. “Just tip into it a little here when you get a chance,” Mike Kutcher, lead development engineer on the car, coached from the passenger seat.

The car will hit 78 miles per hour on electrons only, but with a goose of the pedal, the combustion engine murmured to life. It was barely perceptible; With the stereo on, the only indication of which system was powering the car would have been a sliding scale on the cluster gauge.

The killer app, according to Kutcher, is an all-new variable transmission that seamlessly blends the electric input from the battery in the trunk with the old-fashioned explosions from the cylinders up front. General Motors Co. built the gear unit from scratch and the CT6 is the only vehicle using it at the moment.

The automobile offers 335 horsepower, and it gets from 0 to 60 in an urgent 5.2 seconds whether its burning gas or not—a testament to that magic trick of a transmission.

The hybrid has a purpose-built transmission to blend battery power with combustion output. Cadillac

On our 31-mile trip to a restaurant in Tarrytown, New York, the combustion engine stayed asleep almost the entire time. If we stayed for 4.5 hours and plugged in, the return trip would have been almost entirely electrified as well.

Instead, I selected “sport” mode, nudged the gauge firmly into the gasoline zone and slalomed south on the Saw Mill River Parkway. The CT6, like all of Cadillac’s current sedans, is a joy to drive. The suspension and steering are firm and tight, respectively. For a big car, there’s little listlessness or body lean, and the heavy battery bolted on top of the rear axle planted the car as it pushed through turns.

The burled wood of the dash makes one feel as if they are piloting a vintage cello.

The 2-liter turbo engine is eager and athletic, occasionally drawing a further boost from the dual electric motors. With the regenerative system set to the most aggressive of four settings, I seldom touched the brake.

The interior trimmings, meanwhile, put Tesla to shame. The seats, in particular, are sublime in cinnamon. The burled wood of the dash makes one feel as if they are piloting a vintage cello. It’s all a notch below Porsche’s new Panamera cockpit, but still pure luxury in the country-clubbiest sense of the word.

Cadillac has dialed up the opulence inside. Photographer: Mike Windle

Those in the throes of Tesla fever won’t care, of course. Cadillac knows the CT6 hybrid isn’t a Tesla killer. It already tried that with its ELR coupe, a gorgeous wedge of metal that despite slashed prices turned only a couple of thousand heads in its short time in production.

Ironically, the Cadillac brand is arguably better positioned than any of its rivals to take the fight to Tesla. Brand owner GM has already sourced a battery that can crack the critical 200-mile mark for its Chevrolet Bolt and is ordering enough of them to make the financial engineering work.

Cadillac says it’s far more focused on shape than sustainability—specifically SUV shapes. Its new XT5 quickly became its best-seller and it has three more crossovers in the works.

The flop of the ELR, though, still stings. There was nothing particularly wrong with the car; it just wasn’t quite a Tesla and it wasn’t quite a Cadillac (much of the guts came from the Chevy Volt). The marque will be not making that mistake this time around. The CT6 plug-in is a Cadillac first and foremost, with the electric motors just an intricate and expensive option. The hybrid costs $75,095 and compares in features to the second-highest trim of the standard CT6, which is about $6,000 less.

“As a premium luxury brand, showing that we can do this stuff sends an important message to consumers,” Kutcher explained. In short, Cadillac made a big, beautiful, plug-in sedan because it can.

That sounds like something Elon would do."
2017-05-17 00:00:00,"No Matter What Trump Does, Big Cities Pressing for Cleaner Cars","The auto industry can’t count on a rollback of environmental standards by U.S. President Donald Trump to escape increasing worldwide pressure to make vehicles cleaner.

Rather than national and international bodies, the big push for change is coming from urban centers like Paris, Seoul and Mexico City, and U.S. states such as California, where leaders are reacting to the health hazards caused by deteriorating air quality.

“The air in London is lethal and I will not stand by and do nothing,” Mayor Sadiq Khan said in April as he announced plans to set up an ultra-low emissions zone around the city center.

The most important business stories of the day. Get Bloomberg's daily newsletter.

Automakers can’t afford to ignore these initiatives, especially as a growing slice of the world’s population crowds into urban areas. The push by cities gained momentum in the wake of Volkswagen AG’s emissions-cheating scandal, which highlighted the smog-causing nitrogen oxides emitted by diesel vehicles. Madrid, Athens, Paris and Mexico City have all said they will ban these vehicles from their roads by 2025.

“Electric cars are the main driver of our technology effort because we are seeing many cities, urban cities, which are going to be zero-emissions and because the most affordable, known, popular technology is going to be electric,” Carlos Ghosn, chief executive officer of French carmaker Renault SA and chairman of Japan’s Nissan Motor Co., said in an interview.

In the U.S., 30 cities including New York and Chicago asked automakers for the cost and feasibility of providing 114,000 electric vehicles, including police cruisers, street sweepers and trash haulers, to improve air quality and show demand for low-emission vehicles.

California, the biggest auto market among U.S. states, is seeking to tackle urban air pollution by sticking to stringent emissions standards and promoting zero-emission cars with measures like a $7,000 “clean vehicle” rebate. A dozen other states, including New York, follow California’s standards.

These initiatives present a challenge for automakers seeking to predict the mix of technologies needed for the future, PSA Group CEO Carlos Tavares said at the company’s shareholders meeting on May 10.

“Decisions that were made have an influence on diesel use in a certain number of regions, notably in urban regions, and change consumers’ perception,” said the head of the maker of Peugeot and Citroen cars.

Cities are also teaming up in the effort to improve air quality. London and Seoul joined Paris in a plan to provide independent measurements of car emissions to gauge real-life pollution more accurately than assessments by other authorities.

Meanwhile, Trump is considering whether the U.S. should remain in the UN-sponsored agreement struck in Paris by 200 countries two years ago. The accord aims to limit global warming by reducing greenhouse gas emissions -- including from autos. Outdoor air pollution leads to more than 3 million premature deaths a year, according to a study published in the journal Nature.

For local governments, the issue is immediate and personal, said Emmanuel Bulle, who manages Fitch Ratings’ European manufacturing team. “A few cities alone aren’t recasting the strategy of carmakers, but rather, decisions made by cities illustrate a mega-trend toward cleaner vehicles that manufacturers will have to incorporate in their strategy.”

Here are some of the steps taken by five cities to curb auto emissions:

Paris

The most polluting vehicles were banned from the city center during periods of peak smog and older cars can’t drive along roads like the Champs-Elysees at all during weekdays. To facilitate controls, cars must display a sticker showing pollution levels.

The French capital set up financial incentives, including discounted public transport, for drivers willing to give up their old vehicle. Paris also closed highways along parts of the Seine river, freeing up the waterfront for cyclists and pedestrians.

London

To access London’s crowded center during weekdays, drivers must pay 11.50 pounds ($14) daily. The mayor now plans to create an Ultra Low Emission Zone where older vehicles that don’t meet recent EU emission standards will be forced to pay an additional 12.50-pound fee from April 2019, including at night and during weekends.

Ultra Low Emission Zone where older vehicles that don’t meet recent EU emission standards will be forced to pay an additional 12.50-pound fee from April 2019, including at night and during weekends. London’s mayor, whose city has received warnings from the EU about its pollution levels, also urged the U.K. government to set up a plan to scrap diesel vehicles by providing subsidies for owners of polluting cars who agree to swap for cleaner vehicles.

Stuttgart

The German city, home to Mercedes-Benz parent Daimler AG and the maker of Porsche sports cars, is planning a ban on diesel engines that don’t comply with the most recent European standards during periods of peak pollution.

Mexico City

Air quality has improved since the city introduced a program named ‘Hoy No Circula’ -- or ‘No-Drive Days’ -- restricting circulation based on license plate number. Less-polluting cars, identified with a sticker, are exempt from the restrictions.

Vehicles licensed in the city must undergo emission testing twice a year. The 20 million residents of Greater Mexico City typically wake to a blanket of smog so thick it cloaks volcanoes as high as 18,000 feet that ring the capital.

Tokyo

In Japan, where diesel engines peaked in the 1980s, accounting for as much as 6 percent of new car deliveries, legal action from residents forced Tokyo’s government to introduce particle-emission rules more than a decade ago.

legal action from residents forced Tokyo’s government to introduce particle-emission rules more than a decade ago. The city started requiring diesel owners to install exhaust gas purifiers in 2003 and barred those that didn’t from driving. By 2007, no Japanese carmaker was producing diesel models at home. The technology recently made a comeback as improved filters, turbochargers and fuel injection helped smooth its sooty image. Still, diesel cars represented less than 2 percent of vehicles sold in Japan last year.

The planned “social package” to be announced soon, will target public servants, low-income tax payers and recipients of food subsidies, Deputy Finance Minister Ahmed Kouchouk said in an interview in the resort town of El Gouna on Tuesday. Kouchouk said inflation will average 22.8 percent in the fiscal year starting July 1, a significant revision of the 15.2 percent he estimated in March. The rate will ease to 9.7 percent in the following fiscal year, he said.

Rising consumer prices have emerged as the key challenge facing policy makers since they removed currency controls and raised prices of subsidized fuel in November, paving the way to secure a $12 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund. Officials are trying to ease the strain on Egypt’s 93 million citizens -- nearly half of whom live near or below the poverty line -- and have announced a boost in food subsidies coinciding with the upcoming holy month of Ramadan.

Inflation accelerated to 31.5 percent in April from 30.9 percent a month earlier, according to official data. The month-on-month rise, however, eased to 1.7 percent, its slowest pace since October, prompting some analysts to conclude that the initial shock from the flotation has tapered off.

2017-05-09 00:00:00,Hyundai Heavy's $11 Billion Breakup Paves Way for More Deals,"The world’s second-largest shipbuilder has split itself into four companies, a move that would facilitate a potential sale of some of the businesses.

Hyundai Heavy Industries Co. started trading as four entities Wednesday as the conglomerate tries to insulate the group from a financial crisis at any one of its divisions. The breakup splits the operations into businesses focused on shipbuilding and offshore projects, electric machinery, construction equipment, and industrial robots. The combined market value of the four companies now is about 16.8 trillion won ($14.8 billion), versus 12.5 trillion won when trading in Hyundai Heavy was halted in March.

“Now, each division is being listed separately,” said Paul Choi, head of research for CLSA Securities Korea Ltd. “You can do funding or sell in the market.”

The dismantling of Ulsan, South Korea-based Hyundai Heavy is the latest restructuring round in the country’s ailing shipbuilding industry, home to the world’s top three vessel-manufacturers. The shipbuilders have cut more than 20,000 jobs and sold assets as orders dwindled amid excess capacity and depressed crude oil prices in the past three years that led clients to curtail spending on offshore projects.

Hyundai Robotics Co., Hyundai Electric & Energy Systems Co. and Hyundai Construction Equipment Co. are the three other companies formed after the split.

Shares of Hyundai Heavy rose 15 percent from the adjusted last-closing level to 180,500 won in Seoul. Hyundai Robotics ended the day at 390,000 won, Hyundai Construction at 240,000 won and Hyundai Electric at 280,000 won, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

Daewoo Bailout

Last month, Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering Co., the largest shipbuilder based on its orderbook, averted a payment crisis after bondholders agreed to bail out the company. Daewoo, Hyundai Heavy and Samsung Heavy Industries Co. are the world’s top three shipbuilders.

“We will focus on growth opportunities for the individual companies,” a Hyundai Heavy group spokesman said in response to queries on a possible sale of the spun-off entities. “We will invest for future growth of these units to meet our goal of each becoming a top-five company in their sectors.”

Hyundai Heavy was set up in the 1970s, when its first ships were built at a dockyard in a seaside village on South Korea’s eastern coast. The new Hyundai Heavy, based on the spun-off structure, had sales of 23.7 trillion won last year, accounting for 60 percent of the group’s total before the breakup.

The spinoff cut the shipbuilder’s net debt by half and reduced its debt-to-equity ratio to 95.6 percent at the end of March from 106.1 percent at the end of 2016.

“The possibility of selling non-core operations is high as the group wants to focus on the main business and raise funds to support that,” said Um Kyung-a, an analyst at Shinyoung Securities Co. in Seoul. “Breaking up the divisions and listing them separately will make it easier to determine their value if and when the group decides to sell any unit.”

Hyundai Robotics, the second-largest business by sales after Hyundai Heavy, has become the holding company because it is the biggest shareholder in the other three entities, meeting a Korean fair trade requirement, according to analysts. Hyundai Robotics holds 13.37 percent in each of the three companies and has until May 2019 to comply with a regulatory requirement to increase those stakes to 20 percent.

Cross Holdings

The group also needs to eliminate some cross-shareholdings among its units to meet stock-exchange regulations. Hyundai Mipo Dockyard Co., a unit of Hyundai Heavy, needs to sell a 7.98 percent stake it owns in each of the four companies, which are considering various measures to comply with the rules, the group said in an emailed response to Bloomberg.

Hyundai Heavy group said last month that it plans to invest 3.5 trillion won through 2021 in technology development to help improve efficiency. Of the total, the shipbuilder will spend 2.05 trillion won, Hyundai Electric 680 billion won, and Hyundai Construction 660 billion won.

The divisional breakup was part of a restructuring plan approved by creditors of Hyundai Heavy group that included selling three financial units and other non-core assets.

The streamlined entities should help the management grow them “independently and more successfully,” and attract more investor interest, said Corrine Png, Singapore-based chief executive officer of Crucial Perspective, a research firm focused on Asian transport equities. “Generally, if investors are interested in building long or short positions in the shipbuilding sector, it helps if they do not have to consider the prospects of Hyundai’s excavator sales which have completely different sector drivers.”

The undivided Hyundai Heavy last traded on March 29 at 165,000 won, before the suspension. That was 70 percent off a closing peak of 547,000 won reached in April 2011.

With the outlook for shipbuilding improving, a ""meaningful rebound"" in orders can be expected in the second half of the year, said Um at Shinyoung Securities.

“The worst appears to be over for the Korean shipbuilding industry,” Um said. “Now that Hyundai Heavy can focus on shipbuilding, this is going to benefit its share price.”"
2017-05-08 00:00:00,"Frustrated With Tesla and GM, David Einhorn Amps Up Pressure","Hedge fund manager David Einhorn has two of the most frustrating trades in the market: a long position in General Motors Co. and a short against Tesla Inc.

Both of Einhorn’s plays are in dire need of a catalyst. Despite record earnings, GM’s stock is no higher than its 2010 initial public offering price. And Tesla, which already burned through about half the cash it raised in the first quarter, is up more than 40 percent this year.

So he’s ratcheting up rhetoric on the two automakers. With Tesla, Einhorn has limited his aggression to a shot at its ever bullish shareholders, whom he calls “hypnotized” by Chief Executive Elon Musk. With GM, he’s grown far more aggressive, penning a new letter accusing management of being uninterested in making moves to lift the share price and launching a dedicated website that plugs his proxy battle with the Detroit automaker.

“We think GM stock is undervalued dramatically even in light of the risks of a cycle,” Einhorn said in an interview Thursday. “We don’t see why GM should sit by complacently with an inefficient capital structure while shareholders suffer.”

Proposal Push

A slump in auto sales may be holding auto stocks like GM down, but Einhorn says he thinks management could be doing so much more with its $20.4 billion cash hoard to help investors. So he is aggressively pushing his proposal for a dual class of common stock at GM, a company he praised as recently as March for having “strong operations.”

But while he originally made no accusations against management, he’s now singing a different tune. Einhorn said he presented the proposal to GM in the fall, and the company reviewed it for several months, only to find ways to shoot it down. That’s when he went public.

“The reason it took seven months was that we gave them every opportunity to take it seriously and they failed to do so,” Einhorn said in the interview. “We think they hired advisers to paper over a conclusion that they made before they understood it themselves.”

Einhorn, whose Greenlight Capital owns 3.6 percent of GM, was equally tough in the letter he sent to shareholders May 3, in which he once again laid out his proposal to convert GM’s shares into two issues, a dividend stock and a capital-appreciation stock. The value of those shares would be between $42 and $60 per existing share, Einhorn calculates. GM was trading up 0.7 percent to $34 as of 12:13 p.m. Monday in New York.

The automaker’s board has recommended against the move, and the two sides have been exchanging barbs in the days since.

Different Vantages

Einhorn contends GM’s board isn’t interested in boosting the share price and doesn’t think anything can be done until management proves -- over several years -- that it can make money in a down cycle. “Even long-term shareholders shouldn’t have to be this patient,” he wrote in the shareholder letter.

In a written response, GM called Einhorn’s proposal, “a high-risk experiment in financial engineering that is not in the best interests of GM shareholders, would result in a downgrade of GM’s credit rating, and would not increase value for shareholders.”

Few analysts covering GM have recommended his proposal. Investors who want nothing more than steady cash from dividends can buy bonds or utility stocks, said Erik Gordon, professor at University of Michigan’s Ross School of Business.

“Investors who want only the growth side of GM probably are few these days,” Gordon said. “It is far from a sure thing that splitting the stock will lead to higher overall value for stockholders.”

Key Differences

The two sides have a couple of key differences. GM has argued that there is no precedent to show how two share issues would generate more value than the current common stock. In fact, GM said management took Einhorn’s proposal to credit rating agencies, where they were told such a split could jeopardize the automaker’s investment-grade ratings, making borrowing more expensive and likely putting a downward pressure on shares.

Einhorn said his proposal does not include a legal obligation to repay dividends, while GM has said that the dividend stock would act as debt because it would have to make the payments later on if the dividend were suspended. The three major rating companies all issued reports saying the dual-class shares could be seen as debt and weigh down GM’s credit rating.

But Einhorn said in a May 4 statement that GM misrepresented his proposal to the agencies by eliminating his point that the dividend shares would not be preferred shares and suggesting they would rank senior to the capital-appreciation shares. He urged shareholders to see “GM’s duplicity for themselves by reviewing the term sheet Greenlight provided to GM and the term sheet GM purportedly provided to the rating agencies.”

Tesla Bubble

In other words, Einhorn is frustrated, GM is annoyed and there will be plenty of sniping from both sides until June 6 when the vote takes place. But it’s not the only automaker stock where’s Einhorn needs a change in fortunes.

Einhorn said he also has a small short position in Tesla, which he said in an April 25 shareholder note was one of his biggest losers. Tesla was down 0.4 percent to $307.05 as of 12:16 p.m. in New York Monday, but it’s still up nearly 44 percent this year.

With GM’s shares stagnating this year and Tesla on a surge, the electric car company’s market capitalization passed GM’s in April, with the two jostling for the lead since. As Tesla has soared ahead of the long-awaited Model 3 launch, Einhorn’s called its shares a bubble waiting to burst.

“The enthusiasm for Tesla and other bubble-basket stocks is reminiscent of the March 2000 dot-com bubble,” Einhorn said on Greenlight’s May 3 earnings call. “As was the case then, the bulls rejected conventional valuation methods for a handful of stocks that seemingly could only go up. While we don’t know exactly when the bubble will pop, it eventually will.”

Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes climbed 15 percent to 421 million euros ($459 million) in the year through March, the Saint-Ouen-based company said in a statement on Thursday. That beat a 416 million-euros estimate of eight analysts compiled by Bloomberg. Alstom will propose a dividend of 0.25 euros per share to shareholders in July.

“With 10 billion euros orders for the third year in a row, Alstom has now reached leadership positions on all continents,” Chief Executive Officer Henri Poupart-Lafarge said in the statement. “Alstom’s unique integration capability and its operational excellence have enabled a solid delivery of its record backlog.""

Alstom, which became a transport-focused company after selling most of its energy assets to General Electric Co. in 2015, is looking into how it can participate in consolidation of the rail industry, as international rivals Siemens AG and Bombardier Inc. are said to be discussing a tie-up. The French company is relying on urban transport growth to boost sales, including the launch of an electric bus and an investment in a startup that develops electric driverless shuttles.

The company reiterated targets for 2020, including an adjusted earnings before interest and taxes margin of 7 percent and an annual 5 percent organic growth over the period. Organic sales grew 5 percent to 7.3 billion euros in the past year.

Signalling, systems and services represented 57 percent of total sales, in line with the 2020 objective of 60 percent, Alstom said.

The company is almost 20 percent owned by the French government. The shares fell 0.3 percent to 29.08 euros on Wednesday, and have gained almost a third in the past 12 months."

Siemens AG said it’s moving ahead with a planned split from its health-care division as Europe’s largest engineering company whittles down its core holdings to focus on energy and factory equipment.

Siemens is “well advanced” on the carve-out, Chief Financial Officer Ralf Thomas said in an interview with Bloomberg TV. “We have been preparing all the decisive steps and we are following three very interesting alternatives.”

The possibilities include an initial public offering, spin off or a reverse merger with a public company, he said later to reporters.

Siemens announced in November its intention to spin off or sell shares in the health-care division, called Healthineers, without providing details on timing or the structure of the deal, only that it would retain control of the unit. An IPO could be worth between 30 billion euros ($33 billion) and 40 billion euros, according to a Bloomberg Intelligence analysis. The move would come as Siemens transforms its industrial conglomerate structure to one resembling more of a holding company.

Siemens also plans to fold wind-energy operations into Gamesa Corp. Tecnologia SA of Spain and people familiar with the situation have said it’s in talks with Bombardier Inc. about a combination of the two companies’ rail businesses. In the interview, Thomas said there were “rumors” in the market, and with the merger of China’s two main regional train makers, antitrust authorities should look at the global landscape for the trains business.

“It’s obvious there’s a lot of consolidation going on,” he said.

Shares fell 1.5 percent to 130.50 euros at 9:34 a.m. in Frankfurt, valuing the company at 111 billion euros.

Profit Rose

The Munich-based company reported Thursday that profit from so-called industrial operations rose 18 percent to 2.49 billion euros. Sales climbed 6 percent to 20.2 billion euros, beating an average estimate of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg of 19.7 billion euros.

Orders were higher in nearly all industrial divisions, with the strongest growth in wind and renewable power and energy management contracts. Power and gas orders slumped 38 percent as a contract last year in Egypt wasn’t repeated. Eight out of its nine divisions reported profit margins that were in line or higher than the goals set by the company for 2020.

“The core trends within the period are generally encouraging,” Morgan Stanley analysts including Ben Uglow wrote in a note.

Siemens also confirmed its outlook, saying it would now also include the effects of acquisitions closed in the middle of the first quarter.

The company in January improved its expectation for profit margin for the industrial business to the range of 11 percent to 12 percent, and said basic earnings per share would be in the range of 7.20 euros to 7.70 euros."
2017-05-03 00:00:00,Will ‘Made in China’ Threaten Boeing and Airbus?: QuickTake Q&A,"November 2015 was a big month for Chinese aviation. That was when the state plane manufacturer known as Comac delivered its first passenger aircraft, a 90-seat jet called the ARJ21. May 2017 may prove bigger still, after Comac completed its first test flight of a larger plane, the C919. The new jet aims to take on Boeing Co. and Airbus SE. in an industry segment that’s forecast to generate sales in China alone of more than half a trillion dollars over the next 20 years.

1. What do we know about the new plane?

The C919 will seat 158 to 174 people, six abreast, and is intended to compete with the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 families of planes in the so-called single-aisle market. Comac describes its venture as “ the flower of modern industry.” The C919 made its maiden test flight on May 5, an 80-minute trip out of Shanghai’s Pudong International Airport.

2. When will this flower bloom?

If all goes according to plan, the C919 could be in service as soon as 2019. The ARJ21 took six years to go from first flight to commercial operation, but Comac executives say the C919 will “ definitely” get there faster than that.

3. Should Boeing and Airbus be worried?

It’s too early to say. But it seems credible that a China-based competitor could take a significant chunk of business, since the Chinese market is on course to become the world’s largest as measured by aircraft and passengers. China will need 6,810 planes, worth more than $1 trillion, through 2035, according to Boeing estimates. And the country is forecast to overtake the U.S. as the largest air travel market in terms of passengers around 2024.

4. Where does the C919 fit in?

Single-aisle planes are already the No. 1 segment of the Chinese market, but what’s about to come is breathtaking: Planes in that category are forecast to generate about $535 billion, or 75 percent, of passenger jet sales in China over the next two decades, Boeing says. Currently, the single-aisle category is dominated by Boeing and Airbus.

5. Has anyone bought the C919 yet?

Comac, or Commercial Aircraft Corp. of China Ltd., had orders and commitments from 23 buyers for 570 aircraft as of November 2016. Other than the leasing unit of General Electric Co., all are from local companies. China Eastern Airlines Corp., the nation’s second-largest airline, will be the first carrier to take delivery. Terms haven’t yet been disclosed.

6. Will the C919 fly outside China?

That’s the plan. China’s aviation officials are pushing for bilateral agreements on airworthiness with U.S. and European regulators by the end of 2017 to pave the way for domestically produced aircraft such as the C919 to be flown in those markets.

7. So is this bad news for U.S. and European aviation?

Hardly. While aircraft makers may lose market share, suppliers stand to gain. The C919 counts as many as 16 global corporations as suppliers, including GE and Honeywell International Inc.

8. Why is China so late to the party?

The most important market news of the day. Get our markets daily newsletter.

China has tried developing passenger jets; its first efforts began in 1970. There was the Y-10, which failed to go anywhere after test flights in the 1980s. Then there was the MD-82, a joint development that collapsed after Boeing acquired China’s partner, McDonnell Douglas. There may be more impetus for a breakthrough now, given the burgeoning domestic market and China’s ambition to upgrade its economy to high-level manufacturing, which hinges on projects such as aircraft.

2017-05-02 00:00:00,Volkswagen E-Golf Review: A Sensible Option for a Green Thumb,"While the internet goes gaga every time Tesla introduces a totally new car, less enthusiasm is generally afforded to annual updates on electric cars in the budget category.

I don’t need to explain why.

But the truth is, though the brands that make these cars do not have Elon Musk’s flair for launching near-perfect products in an explosion of pomp and adoration, they are regularly iterating. And their cars improve by leaps and bounds with each passing update. A lot of progress on electric car technology is being made—not least in exposing it to new audiences and testing what different buyers like and need.

The new Volkswagen e-Golf hits showrooms next month. Photographer: Hannah Elliott/Bloomberg

Which brings me to the Volkswagen e-Golf. It’s not a car I’d typically review—those tend to be rather more aggressive and good-looking—but I wanted to check on a new offering from a very sensible category. VW isn’t reaching for the stars with this one, but is it meeting its own goals?

What It Should Do

Volkswagen says the 2017 e-Golf should add “all the benefits of an electric vehicle to the Golf’s ""fun-to-drive, yet practical"" formula, forever ending the idea that compact EVs must be bland and focused only on efficiency. In short: It should be just like the spunky $20,000 Golf but electric. (Pricing for the e-Golf has yet to be released.) With its improved performance the latest iteration of e-Golf, though it looks basically the same as it did last year, gets pretty close to that goal. I’d give it a solid B-plus.

This is the plug-in electric version of VW's $20,000 Golf. Photographer: Hannah Elliott/Bloomberg

Look, it’s not fabulous. The internal fabrics are thin, the brakes are alternately soft and abrupt, the body is boxy, and the acceleration feels as though the thing just woke up from a nap. But it’s a perfectly prudent car. It has a lot of room inside, it’s organized rationally, and everything in it has a purpose.

To many drivers, beautiful objects can feel frivolous—even too obviously good-looking to actually buy. To wit: My mother thinks Teslas are “pretty” cars, but she wouldn’t buy one even if she could afford it. Just as she selects her shoes and her jeans, she chooses to buy things that are comfortable and practical and whose aesthetics fit her frugal, Protestant nature. The e-Golf falls into that camp.

How to Measure It?

Usually when we talk about the performance of an electric car, the conversation centers around its electric performance: How long can the car go on one charge and under what driving conditions? How long does it take to charge it once you’ve drained the battery?

Photographer: Hannah Elliott/Bloomberg

The e-Golf comes new this year with a revised battery that leads the increase in range from 83 miles to 125 miles on one charge. (This is under the most efficient “Eco+” drive mode.) Similarly, the power from the 2016 version has risen from 115 hp on an 85 kW motor to 134 hp on a 100 kw electric motor. Torque is up 15 pound-feet too, to 214 pound-feet. It is faster than last year’s e-Golf, with a 60 mph sprint speed of 9.6 seconds.

You can also charge it to 80-percent full in less than an hour under “DC Fast-Charging” mode (the apparatus costs extra) or reach a full charge on a 240-volt outlet in six hours. According to EPA estimates at 13¢ per kilowatt-hour, it’ll cost just $550 to fuel the e-Golf for a year.

These specs significantly improve on last year’s example, and all are reasons enough to buy the newest e-Golf. It doesn’t go as fast or as far as the Tesla, but it has better MPGe ratings and can drive longer after an hour of at-home charging. (Roughly 100 miles vs. Tesla Model S’s stated 52 sans supercharger.) The car makes good sense.

The brakes can be adjusted to highly regenerative or more subtly regenerative, which makes them less abrupt when stopping. Photographer: Hannah Elliott/Bloomberg

But Is It “Fun”?

How does the car compare with the conventional Golf when it comes to driving fun, as promised by VW? Decently, it turns out. But it doesn’t go the full 18 holes.

Travel with us, drive with us, eat with us. Get our weekly Pursuits newsletter.

The conventional Golf has 170 hp but just 184 pound-feet of torque. That’s fewer than e-Golf. But the Golf can hit 60 mph a full two seconds faster than its electrified sibling. And with its engine noise and vibration, active transmission, and nonregenerative brakes, it feels more real to drive. Do you care about that when you’re using your car for hauling your kids and all their gear or strapping your skis to the top? Maybe not.

The interior of the car is quiet and spacious. Photographer: Hannah Elliott/Bloomberg

Still, to me, driving the e-Golf is like driving an iPhone. It’s fine, but it’s not tactile or engaged. Points are due the e-Golf for its many comforts: optional driver assistance, adaptive cruise control, forward collision warning with autonomous emergency braking and pedestrian monitoring, lane assist, and blind-spot monitor with rear traffic alert. I bring these up to point out that if you buy the e-Golf, it’s not like you’re foregoing every creature comfort. Yes, the car can feel spare inside. But it’s not monastic.

Points also for the ability to access three different levels of regenerative braking, which means you don’t have to jolt.your.way.through.midtown if you don’t want to.

New this year for the e-Golf are an 8-inch touch screen and a 12-inch LCD panel behind the steering wheel. Photographer: Hannah Elliott/Bloomberg

Ultimately though, VW misses its goal to make the e-Golf as fun to drive as the regular version. This is no contest.

Good Looks

Thank heavens VW didn’t do something weird to make the e-Golf look different from the boxy standard version and, more importantly, the performance-focused Golf STI. Consumers want to drive cool or attractive cars regardless of what’s under the hood.

The e-Golf has three driving modes with Normal/Eco/Eco+ functionality. Each achieves various levels of efficiency. Photographer: Hannah Elliott/Bloomberg

This year VW has made the e-Golf sharper than its predecessor and fresher than cars similar to it in size and function, such as the Honda Civic and the current Jetta. The squared-off rear has LED taillights now, and the 16-inch aluminum-alloy rims are flushed so close inside the wheel arches that the car looks a little hunkered. There’s even a little flip edge at the top of the hatchback for extra verve.

The only thing that tips off onlookers that you’re driving the plug-in version of the Golf are its small badges and the absence of any tailpipes at the rear. That’s a good thing.

The e-Golf has seating for five adults. Photographer: Hannah Elliott/Bloomberg

In the quiet, simple interior, special sound-absorbent materials to counter the lack of wind- and tire noise that a traditional combustion engine typically mutes. It’s not as quiet as a Rolls-Royce (we can’t hardly expect that, can we?) but it is quiet like a Sunday morning. Peaceful. An 8-inch touch screen and a 12-inch LCD panel behind the steering wheel are easy and effective to use. The back seat is flat but not uncomfortable. The trunk is empty and large, like a shipping crate. Easily used.

And that is the charm of this car. It is humble of mien and practical in nature. And if you buy it, the extended battery range, quicker charging, and spacious, useful interior will serve you reliably and well. That is beautiful in its own right.

2017-04-24 00:00:00,The Electric Car Revolution Now Faces Its Biggest Test,"Are electric cars ready to stand on their own?

If you took a spin down to the New York International Auto Show last week and saw the $37,500 Chevy Bolt (electric) parked next to the strikingly similar $17,000 Chevy Cruze (gasoline), the answer is probably a hard no. The Bolt is arguably a better car than the Cruze—but not $20,000 better.

Edmunds, the car-research company, recently weighed in with a hard no of its own, warning that the elimination of a $7,500 U.S. tax credit is “likely to kill [the] U.S. EV market.” Edmunds pinned its argument on what happened in Georgia, a state that became an unlikely leader in electric cars thanks to an extra $5,000 incentive. At one point, almost four percent of new cars being sold in Georgia were electric. Then they pulled away the punch bowl.

Source: Edmunds/IHS Markit

But a very illuminating thing happened after Georgia's incentives expired. Unlike the Nissan Leaf, which made up the majority of the EV market there, sales of electric-luxury Teslas were barely affected by the loss of the tax credit. In fact, more people are buying Teslas in Georgia today than during the subsidy years.

The Tesla exception shows what happens when an electric car reaches parity with fuel-burning competitors in both price and function. Unlike the Leaf and the BMW i3, the Tesla Model S is quicker than similarly priced gasoline cars, has a long driving range, extensive fast-charging network, and is packed with unrivaled tech advances like Autopilot and wireless software updates.

The most important business stories of the day. Get Bloomberg's daily newsletter.

As a result, the Model S is now the best-selling large luxury vehicle in America. Changes to state or federal incentives are unlikely to alter that fact. But those Teslas are premium cars that start around $70,000. For plugins to really pass the subsidy test and take over the auto industry, they’ll need to prove themselves in cheaper classes of car, and there will have to be more manufacturers besides Tesla.

When might that happen?

The primary cost for an electric car is its battery, responsible for almost half the pricetag of a mid-sized plugin. If you take that away, electric cars are much cheaper to produce and maintain than internal combustion vehicles. (That’s why French carmaker Renault sells its popular Zoe without a battery, which customers pay a monthly fee to lease.)

For true mass-market appeal, the up-front sticker price is what matters most, and battery prices must come down further. Fortunately, prices are falling fast—by roughly 20 percent a year. The manufacturing cost of electric cars will fall below their gasoline counterparts across the board around 2026, according to a recent analysis by Bloomberg New Energy Finance.

Source: Bloomberg New Energy Finance

The question of when electric cars will cost the same as their combustion counterparts isn’t academic. The $7,500 federal incentive is set to taper off as each manufacturer reaches its 200,000th U.S. sale. For Tesla, that day will arrive sometime next year. Nissan and GM won’t be far behind—and any extension of the subsidy by the Trump administration seems unlikely.

Another thing that makes electric cars more expensive is that, at lower volumes (less than 100,000 a year of the early models), even the traditional components of a car come at higher costs. Low production numbers and high battery development costs created a valley of despair for EVs that lasted decades, which is why subsidies have been critical to giving the sector enough breathing room to eventually stand on its own.

Source: Bloomberg New Energy Finance

Government incentives were crucial to the birth of the EV industry, and many countries and local governments will continue to offer them because of the critical role electric cars play in reducing pollution and combatting climate change.

But even where governments are less enlightened, the valley of despair is coming to an end. Tesla, the first to approach price and function parity in the Model S sedan and Model X SUV, will attempt to recreate that magic later this year with the Model 3, a $35,000 entry-level luxury sedan. A longer-range Nissan Leaf will be unveiled in September, and depending on its pricetag, it could begin to approach the parity zone in the sub-$30,000 market.

And then watch out: In 2018, Volkswagen plows into electrification with an Audi SUV and the first high-speed U.S. charging network to rival Tesla’s Superchargers. Jaguar and Volvo both have promising cars on the way too, and by 2020, the avalanche really begins, with Mercedes, VW, General Motors and others releasing dozens of new models.

Source: Bloomberg New Energy Finance

When the U.S. incentives begin to expire next year, don’t expect a Georgia-sized collapse in the market. The period of greatest peril is ending for EVs, and the time of greatest promise is beginning. All the top carmakers are investing billions of dollars to electrify their drivetrains, and the smart ones will compete aggressively on pricing in the short-term in order to establish market share for the long haul. Incentives are important, but they won’t define the market for much longer."
2017-04-24 00:00:00,SLM Said to Tap Lazard to Study Options After GE Failed Bid,"SLM Solutions AG has hired Lazard Ltd. to help it explore strategic options six months after General Electric Co. withdrew a 680 million-euro ($737 million) offer for the 3-D printing company, according to people familiar with the matter.

The review could lead to the sale of a stake in the Luebeck, Germany-based company or even a complete takeover, the people said, asking not to be identified because the talks are private. The shares rose as much as 5.2 percent on the news and traded 3 percent higher as of 11:58 a.m. in Frankfurt.

""We’ve hired Lazard to advise us on how to best deal with the new situation following the failed transaction with General Electric,"" Uwe Boegershausen, SLM’s chief finance officer and interim chief executive officer, told Bloomberg News on Monday. He declined to provide additional details.

Two of the company’s largest owners are willing to sell their combined stake of almost 30 percent, a step that would pave the way for a new anchor shareholder to swoop in, the people said. The move may be a prelude to a full takeover of Luebeck-based SLM, which makes machines that produce aircraft components and other parts with a printing technique known as additive manufacturing, they said.

Company founder Hans Joachim Ihde, who holds 24 percent, and DPE Deutsche Private Equity B.V., which owns 5.4 percent, are willing to sell their stakes, enabling a potential buyer to purchase nearly 30 percent at once, the people said. Thirty percent is the threshold at which stakeholders are obliged to make a public offer under German takeover law.

Failed Deal





Exclusive insights on technology around the world. Get Fully Charged, from Bloomberg Technology.

Possible suitors, which include family offices as well as large companies like China’s Shanghai Electric Group Co. Ltd. or Applied Materials Inc. and United Technologies Corp., have been invited to submit notifications of interest in May, these people said. A combined stake purchase would make the acquirer SLM’s largest shareholder, ahead of the Paul Singer-led hedge fund Elliott Management Corp., which amassed 20 percent of SLM after GE first announced its offer of 38 euros a share.

Spokespersons for Applied Materials, UTC and Lazard declined to comment. Shanghai Electric wasn’t immediately available to comment.

Boston, Mass.-based GE walked away from the deal in October after failing to meet the 75 percent acceptance threshold because Elliott refused to tender its stake, betting on a higher offer. The U.S. engineering behemoth instead moved to buy SLM’s German rival Concept Laser, leaving SLM scrambling because GE is one of its largest customers.

Share Decline

Consolidation is stirring the global market for industrial 3-D printers and materials, which grew 17 percent to $6.06 billion last year, according to data from Wohlers Associates Inc. The research firm projects the market to balloon to $26.2 billion by 2022.

SLM’s shares have taken a hit since GE announced it wouldn’t raise its offer on Oct. 21, calling Elliott’s bluff.

The interview was Yildirim’s first since an April 16 referendum, which was preceded by massive government-backed stimulus for lending after the nation’s slowest growth rate since a contraction in 2009. The referendum, backed by Yildirim, hands President Recep Tayyip Erdogan enhanced executive authority and by 2019, will lead to the abolishing of Yildirim’s current job.

“We’ll continue to take such measures,” Yildirim said of the economic stimulus program, speaking in a ballroom at the Cankaya Palace. “The revival of the domestic economy will increase even more.”

Investors have so far welcomed the outcome of the referendum, even as questions remain about how Erdogan will use his enhanced powers to revive growth, bring inflation under control and support the currency, which has lost almost a quarter of its value against the dollar in the past year. The benchmark Turkish stock gauge closed at a record high on Monday, while the lira has appreciated 1.8 percent against the greenback since the vote.

Infrastructure Spending

A former transportation minister, Yildirim’s attention focused largely on infrastructure investment. Turkey plans to spur spending of about 100 billion liras ($28 billion) in rail projects over the next 10 years, as well as pouring money into new highways, hospital developments, airports, shipping, student dorm facilities, electric energy and urban regeneration.

“This is why Turkey’s economy tripled in size and exports quadrupled” since the ruling AK Party came to power in 2002, he said. “While the world was running from crisis to crisis, Turkey carried out some of the largest projects in the world.”

Urban regeneration, which includes destroying and rebuilding structures that are insufficiently earthquake-proof, will help to drive domestic consumption and employment over the next decades, he said. Many of those projects will be moved off the government budget through partnerships with the private sector, he said.

“Large projects can’t be done out of the state’s general budget because first you’re going to do your spending on people’s health, education and defense,” he said. “If there’s money left over, you’ll do big infrastructure projects.” Because in the past that wasn’t possible, Turkey turned to public-private partnerships and build-operate-transfer models, and plans to continue investing in that way, he said.

Interest Rates

The government maintains its commitment to lowering borrowing costs -- as well as its unorthodox view that higher interest rates cause inflation -- and is finding creative ways to reduce financing costs without interfering with the central bank, he said. The newly established Turkey Wealth Fund, whose strategic plan has not yet been revealed, will also be used for that purpose, he said.

“The Wealth Fund is a structure that is aimed at lowering the interest rate burden in financial transactions mainly in areas of investment as well as providing added value to the country,” he said. The fund could take over financing for existing projects from banks and offering investors lower rates, he said. “That way the banks can use the resources they have for new projects, and this is a serious possibility,” he said.

Turkey will probably approach its 4.4 percent growth target this year, Yildirim said. The government has no current plans to enlarge its 250-billion-lira credit guarantee fund, which helped push loan growth in the first quarter to above 20 percent. An interest-free loan program for small businesses targets 12 billion liras in usage from 460,000 companies, compared with 157,000 companies that have so far used 5 billion liras, he said.

Yildirim said the government has no plans to call for early elections to allow a full switch to the presidential system to happen earlier than the current Nov. 2019 timeframe. Investors shouldn’t be confused by competing messages on economic policy coming from the cabinet and from some of Erdogan’s economic advisers, he said.

“The advisers can say whatever they want, but the responsibility is with us,” he said."

2017-04-20 00:00:00,Paying Nuclear Losers for ‘Clean’ Power Upends U.S. Markets,"Some U.S. states are trying to save money-losing nuclear plants -- and disrupting America’s electricity markets in the process.

New York and Illinois have cleared the way for nuclear power to be subsidized with higher fees on buyers -- aid normally reserved for renewable energy like solar and wind. One reason policy makers gave was to protect jobs at aging plants teetering on closure. Another was nuclear’s emission-free electricity, because states are trying to address climate change by relying less on fossil fuels like coal and natural gas. Connecticut and Ohio are considering similar moves, and pressure is mounting in New Jersey.

But federal regulators and gas-fueled generators including Dynegy Inc. and Calpine Corp. say the states are fundamentally altering the way wholesale power markets work. Armed with billions of dollars in new clean-energy benefits, higher-cost nuclear generators can now compete with companies that get no aid. The first test comes next month when PJM Interconnection LLC, the biggest grid, takes bids to supply power from Chicago to Washington.

“Markets only work if everyone’s competing evenly,” said Joseph Bowring, president of Monitoring Analytics, the company that oversees PJM’s electricity market. “If some get subsidies, then other people are going to want subsidies. And then pretty soon, we’re going to be competing for subsidies instead of competing in the market.”

For a primer on pressures generators face in PJM auction, read this.

While nuclear power has kept its share of U.S. electricity at around 20 percent over the past decade, it’s become a high-cost supplier with the emergence of gas-fired turbines burning cheap shale fuel, as well as more-efficient wind farms and solar panels. The country now gets more electricity from gas than from coal, which has seen its market share plunge.

All that cheap fuel has cut electricity prices, creating financial problems for aging nuclear plants. Five have closed in the past five years and more shutdowns are planned, primarily for economic reasons, according to the Energy Information Administration.

The industry calculus began to change in August when New York handed nuclear plants so-called credits for supplying carbon-free power to the state, which means the generators can raise an additional $500 million a year from higher rates. Four months later, Illinois created similar credits to keep money-losing reactors open and 1,500 people employed.

Extra Fee

The way the incentives work is similar to what states have been doing for years to encourage emission-free power. Generators get “credits” for a designated amount of electricity. When that is sold to utilities, the buyers pay the generators an extra fee, which can be recovered in the form of higher bills to customers.

Nuclear incentives saved two plants in Illinois and three in New York, according to Kit Konolige, a senior utilities analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. If subsidies were used to keep open all the nuclear plants in PJM, which doesn’t include New York, electricity supply in the region would be 10 percent higher than otherwise, depressing prices, he said.

On May 10, generators will begin bidding to supply a year of electricity in the PJM region starting June 2020, in return for fixed payments. It’s going to be one of the most closely watched events in the industry this year. Exelon Corp.’s Quad Cities nuclear plant was priced out of last year’s auction. This time, it can expect a subsidy from Illinois customers.

Only the newest and largest nuclear plants can sell power for $25 a megawatt hour, which is the price offered by most gas plants, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. With the help of credits, nuclear power narrows the gap, and generators can offer electricity at close to that price. Wholesale power at a major trading hub within PJM averaged $23.90 a megawatt-hour at 11:28 a.m. Friday in New York, grid data compiled by Genscape show.

‘Keep Running’

“If you’re getting revenue from one source, you don’t need as much from the auction, so you’re willing to accept less to keep running,” Konolige said.

As a result, prices in this May’s auction for a region covering Chicago may plunge about 16 percent from a year earlier, according to industry consultant Wood Mackenzie Ltd.

Nuclear-plant owners Exelon and FirstEnergy Corp. defend the incentives, saying they keep emissions down and layoffs at bay. Illinois is promoting “zero-carbon energy just as states have done for years to promote wind, solar and other forms of clean energy,” said Paul Adams, an Exelon spokesman.

Market Threat

For its part, Illinois says it’s just picking up where power markets leave off. Credits promote the state’s environmental goals “completely apart from energy and capacity markets” that don’t place a value on low-carbon power, the Illinois Commerce Commission said in a Feb. 3 filing.

The most important business stories of the day. Get Bloomberg's daily newsletter.

Operators of cheaper gas-fired power plants, including Dynegy, Calpine and NRG Energy Inc., describe the credits as “bailouts” that threaten to kill competitive markets at the expense of electricity customers. Electricity customers would pay $3.9 billion more if all nuclear plants competing in PJM’s and New England’s wholesale markets were part of programs like New York’s, a Bloomberg Intelligence analysis shows.

“It’s the equivalent of going out to buy a new car and finding out they’re giving them away down the street,” said Abe Silverman, deputy general counsel at Princeton, New Jersey-based NRG. “How are you supposed to compete with that?”

In Connecticut, consumer advocates are fighting the credits and accusing nuclear-plant owners of a money grab.

“Single-state solutions are going to screw up the entire deregulated market,” said John Erlingheuser, advocacy director for the AARP in Connecticut.

Fix Needed

PJM acknowledges the subsidies will be disruptive. The grid is considering a market for states that want to include the social cost of heat-trapping carbon dioxide in energy bills, Stu Bresler, who runs the power market, said in a Bloomberg Intelligence webinar Thursday. Nothing’s concrete, and more discussion is needed, he said.

The federal agency that regulates power markets is so concerned that the acting chairman called for both sides to meet and figure out a compromise.

“The markets weren’t designed to” compensate nuclear resources for carbon-free power, “and that’s something those state programs are seeking to do,” said Cheryl LaFleur, acting chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. “That’s something that we have to work out.”"
2017-04-20 00:00:00,"Guns, Votes and Clans: How One Corner of Turkey Elevated Erdogan","A journey through villages in the war-torn southeast shows the story of last weekend's vote is anything but simple.

Just after 10 a.m. on the morning of Turkey’s constitutional referendum, Suat Oztekin arrived with three colleagues to monitor the vote in a remote Kurdish village.

He left, he says, after being refused entry by the village headman, threatened at gunpoint with arrest and punched in the face by a soldier.

Oztekin’s account, disputed by a group of locals, may come as little surprise to opponents of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his effort to change Turkey from a parliamentary to a presidential republic, with few checks or balances on his power. Yet it also shows that the story of the referendum — particularly in war-raked eastern Turkey where Erdogan benefited from a notable swing in his favor from mostly Kurdish voters — isn’t straightforward.



The narrowness of the 51 percent victory and irregularities surrounding it led to a damning preliminary report from international monitors and a rare challenge to the result.

In the Kurdish east, though, there’s another set of concerns: physical and economic security and even the nature of democracy in patriarchal villages. That makes it hard to discern how much of the winning margin was secured by what opponents are calling manipulation and what was down to calculated self-interest.



Under Pressure

Oztekin and other Kurdish leaders from the Peoples’ Democratic Party, or HDP, in the eastern district of Kozluk said their observers were blocked from monitoring 17 of the region’s approximately 120 polling stations. In the village of Oyuktas and elsewhere, he said, officials from the governing Justice and Development Party and security forces brought intense pressure on voters to vote “yes.”

Some stations reported a remarkable 100 percent vote for the pro-Erdogan “yes” side, or as few as one or two “no” ballots to 200 or 300 in favor. Others showed more votes cast than the polling stations had voters registered.

In his victory speech on Sunday, Erdogan thanked voters in the southeast for what he said was a 10 to 20 percent boost in his support there, compared with levels in the last general election in 2015. Since that time the area has been torn by renewed warfare between state security forces and the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, better known as the PKK, a listed terrorist organization. It isn’t immediately clear why that history should endear the government to ordinary Kurds.

“They put so much pressure on people and used all of the power of the state, but I still don’t think this 51 percent is correct,” said Cuneyt Yildiz, 53, a film maker.

Destruction



Yildiz’s two houses and livelihood were destroyed during the government’s battle to drive PKK forces out of Sur, a district of about 10,000 inhabitants on the outskirts of the regional capital, Diyarbakir. Residents are now dependent on handouts and the promise of compensation for their lost homes, with officials strongly hinting a “yes” vote would produce better treatment, said Yildiz.

The region is still under emergency rule and curfews are widespread. As many as half a million people have been displaced in total. Access to towns such as Lice and Kulp, which also recorded zero “no” votes in some polling stations, remains blocked due to continued fighting in the area.

In Silvan, a town of 40,000 on one of Turkey’s main east-west highways, a convoy of three armored cars was on patrol Wednesday evening, their gun turrets spinning watchfully.

“This region feels as though it is under occupation,” said Nevzat Oezgen, an HDP board member in Diyarbakir. “There was no political campaigning or democracy going on here.”

And yet, while evidence of apparent ballot fraud during the referendum mounts, there are other factors that may have boosted the “yes” vote here.

In Oyuktas, local elders denied any violence was used against Oztekin, a fellow Kurd whose brother fought and died with the PKK in the nearby mountains. But he was an outsider who they said had failed to ask the headman’s permission to enter the polling station and wanted to canvass for the HDP.

That could have upset their own way of deciding how their village should vote.

Mustafa Altas, the deputy headman, or muhtar, said electoral decisions are taken collectively, with elders meeting each other over glasses of tea to discuss how various parts of the village’s large extended family should vote.

Jailed Leaders



In 2015, that choice was overwhelmingly for the HDP, because its charismatic new leader, Selahattin Demirtas, was promising a democratic path to peace and economic stability for Kurds, Altas said. Then war broke out between the government and the PKK. Demirtas is now in jail along with dozens of other HDP activists from Kozluk and hundreds nationwide, accused of supporting the PKK.

The elders opted to hedge their bets. “We decided to vote 220 for ‘yes’ and 135 for ‘no,’” said Altas. He voted “yes,” and as “no” voters joined the discussion they insisted there had been no pressure from the muhtars to change their minds. “The HDP can do nothing for us now, and we will give our votes to whomever can help us,” said Altas. The actual result was 219 to 134.

Such collective voting in highly patriarchal Kurdish villages also appears to have worked the other way, with some polling stations around Kozluk opposed to handing Erdogan greater powers by as much as 249 to four.

Many of those displaced by fighting in Kurdish nationalist strongholds such as Sur simply couldn’t return to their registered homes to vote, while a smaller Kurdish party switched allegiance to the “yes” campaign. Even some of the villages that were unanimous in support of Erdogan proved less mysterious on inspection. One was the hometown of an AKP lawmaker and staunchly loyal to him.

An hourlong drive into mountains on a vertiginous road that required removing rock falls to pass found voters in hamlets around Akcali only too proud to say that none had opted for “no.” They were Arabs, originally from Iraq, thankful to Erdogan for building their winding road and providing them with electricity and water.

With so much violence in and around Turkey, Kurds switched to vote “yes” because they increasingly see one man rule as the best way to retrieve stability and build the economy, said Turkan Gurler, an AKP board member for Diyarbakir and wife of a wealthy local businessman.

“They love Tayyip Baba,” she said.

The narrow and contested nature of Erdogan’s victory, which has left the geopolitically critical nation more bitterly divided than ever, makes that seem at best optimistic, however.

“All politics are lies,” said Altas. “Now the referendum is over, things can get back to normal.”

2017-04-19 00:00:00,Toyota Hybrids May Have Finally Cracked China,"For years, Toyota Motor Corp.’s lineup of hybrid gas and electric powered cars faced a great wall of indifference in China. Taxes on imported components drove up the price of franchise brands like the Prius way beyond the budgets of most car buyers, while the government steered subsidies to plug-in electric vehicles.

Toyota may have finally cracked the code. The Japanese automaker’s decision to localize its production of powertrain components such as battery packs and motors in 2015 has allowed it to introduce hybrid versions of its Corolla and Levin brands at the same price as their gas-engine counterparts.

On top of that, the Chinese government is now elevating the importance role of hybrids in its push to hit aggressive emission targets by 2020. Toyota sees an opportunity. “Toyota is showing other carmakers that hybrids have a role to play to help reach the emission requirements,” said Zhou Jincheng, an auto analyst at researcher Fourin Inc.

Deliveries of combined gasoline-electric cars more than tripled to a record 111,981 units in 2016 from a year earlier, according to market researcher LMC Automotive. About two thirds of the sales were from Toyota’s Levin and Corolla hybrids, whose key components have been locally available since 2015.

The surge in hybrid demand -- admittedly from a low base -- comes in the aftermath of scandal in the Chinese electric vehicle industry, which has been accused by government inspectors of padding sales and faking transactions to get government subsidies.

President Xi Jinping’s administration wants 5 million “new-energy vehicles” -- either fully electric, plug-in hybrids or fuel-cell vehicles -- hitting the roads by 2020 to reduce tailpipe emissions and a national reliance on imported oil. Central and local governments have spent 15 billion yuan ($2.3 billion) subsidizing new-energy vehicle makers since 2009, according to state-run China Central Television.

Carmakers will have to cut gas consumption by 26 percent from the 2015 level to meet the government’s target of 5 liters per 100 kilometers by 2020, according to an estimate by Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. The government plans to phase out subsidies after 2020.

To get there, the Chinese government last year elevated the role of hybrids by setting its first sales targets for the segment, Bloomberg reported. The aim is to have hybrids account for 8 percent of total passenger vehicle sales by 2020 and rise to 20 percent by 2025, according to the Technology Roadmap for Energy Saving and New Energy Vehicles, drafted for the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology.

More Offerings

Toyota showed two China-focused concept models sharing the basic design of the Camry and CH-R at the Shanghai car show. The automaker is also introducing the LS 500h hybrid sedan.

“Current Chinese rules focus on new-energy vehicles, but we still believe that hybrid is a very effective technology for dealing with China’s vehicle emissions regulations,” Hiroji Onishi, Toyota’s China chief, told reporters on Wednesday. The company plans to raise the ratio of hybrid sales to more than 30 percent of total China sales by as early as 2020, he said.

Before last year, Toyota and Honda Motor Co. were the only carmakers selling hybrids in China, delivering a total of 36,540 units in 2015. After local production of key components, Toyota sold more than 70,000 units of Levin and Corolla compact sedans, which consumes 4.2 liters of gasoline per 100 kilometers, in 2016.

That same year, at least five automakers added conventional hybrids to their lineups in China, including General Motors’s Chevrolet Malibu XL, as well as the Ford Mondeo and Nissan Murano.

Yet unlike Toyota, other hybrid makers with no local production face a 25 percent customs tax on imported cars and components. For example, a hybrid Nissan Murano starts from 297,800 yuan, compared with the 238,800 yuan starting price for a gasoline version. Toyota has struggled to sell its Prius, which has no localized production for the same reason. A Prius starts from 229,800 yuan to 269,800 yuan, on par with a luxury Audi Q3 SUV.

At the Shanghai show, Honda said it will introduce a hybrid version of its CR-V model first in China later this year to meet Chinese fuel efficiency standards, according to Yasuhide Mizuno, Honda’s China chief. Nissan’s planning to bring its e-power technology, a hybrid design which allows the car to run on a motor powered by a gasoline engine, to China, said Jun Seki, the carmaker’s China head, in an interview.

Domestic Carmakers

Chinese carmakers are also developing their own hybrid cars. Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Co., owner of Volvo Cars, late last year introduced the Emgrand EC7 hybrid, whose powertrain was jointly developed with Hunan Corun New Energy Co., a supplier to Toyota. Anhui Jianghuai Automobile Group Corp also unveiled in Shanghai a hybrid version of its new flagship crossover S7, the carmaker’s first conventional hybrid model.

Geely and Corun said they will share the hybrid powertrain technologies, dubbed CHS as in China Hybrid System, with other companies that want to develop gas-electric vehicles. Chongqing Changan Automobile Co. and Kunming Yunnei Power Co. have already joined the technological alliance.

Wang Yanbin, general manager of the joint venture, said this month the companies have reached a supply agreement with several domestic carmakers and will soon start delivery. In addition, a plant with an annual capacity of 300,000 units will start operation in 2017.

Good Intentions

Whether the government promotion efforts for hybrids will include subsidies is unclear. Some Chinese cities such has Beijing and Suzhou used to dole out subsidies as much as 100,000 yuan for electric cars, while hybrids were not eligible for such rebates in most places.

Premier Li Keqiang has been vocal in his support for alternative-energy cars, with its ambitious goal to have 5 million “new energy vehicles” on the roads by 2020.

“Overall speaking there is some imbalance between supply and demand in China. The government distorted the relationship between supply and demand by fabricating demand for pure electric vehicles,” said Zhong Faping, chairman of Corun. “Premier Li is calling for making our skies blue again and the advanced hybrids can help a lot with that mission.”"
2017-04-18 00:00:00,Singapore Businesses Brace for Higher Costs,"Businesses in Singapore are bracing for higher costs in a country that’s already among the world’s most expensive to live in.

From a 30 percent increase in water prices to higher diesel costs to a looming carbon tax, manufacturers are being forced to adjust their operations to remain competitive in an economy that’s only recently recovering from an export slump. It also signals a pick-up in inflation, an outcome the central bank flagged in its monetary policy statement last week.

Of the measures announced by Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat in his February budget, higher water tariffs have generated the most debate and anxiety among Singaporeans. Having kept the cost steady since 2000, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong is clear why the government needs to adjust prices: as an island nation that’s water-stressed, the state needs to pay for expensive desalination plants. Higher prices will also make consumers more aware of their usage of the scarce resource.

For Lee Soon Kiat, director of government relations at semiconductor maker Globalfoundries Inc., higher water tariffs -- to be implemented in two phases beginning in July -- means extra costs of as much as S$5 million ($3.6 million) a year at plants producing electrical circuits.

“It’s clear that it will add to our operating costs,” said Lee, who is also a member of the executive committee of Singapore’s Semiconductor Industry Association. “It’s an issue that our industry will have to adapt to, and continue to pursue water saving or recycling measures in our processes.”

Competitiveness Index

Singapore is routinely ranked among the top when it comes to global competitiveness, mainly because of its low company tax rates, good infrastructure and easy procedures to open a business, rather than cost effectiveness. It was placed fourth out of 61 countries in last year’s world competitiveness index -- compiled by the Swiss business school IMD -- but ranked among the lowest, at 57, on scores for cost of living.

Song Seng Wun, a regional economist at CIMB Private Bank in Singapore, said the government is banking on companies accepting higher costs in exchange for the city state’s other advantages: its reliable power and water supply, business-friendly framework, stable legal and political system and competitive tax rates.

“Singapore has never been the cheapest place to do business,” he said. “Other factors have to be strong enough to keep Singapore as a very competitive place.” Having a green and healthy environment is “also a competitive advantage,” he said.

The moves fit into the government’s broader goal of forcing businesses to innovate in order to boost productivity, from encouraging companies to adopt digital technologies to re-skilling workers to keep pace with global change.

Tiger Beer

Travel with us, drive with us, eat with us. Get our weekly Pursuits newsletter.

At S$1.21 per cubic meter currently, water for industrial use in Singapore is already more expensive than in many other Asian countries, and several times pricier than in China, according to Simon Powell, head of Asian utilities research at UBS Group AG in Hong Kong. That’s forcing companies that rely on significant amounts of water, such as power plants and the brewery that produces the local Tiger beer, to review their consumption needs.

Tuas Power Ltd., one of the largest power generators in Singapore, had been implementing steps to save water before the cost announcement was made, said spokeswoman Michele Sit. The company will install additional meters to track unusually high consumption or wastage of water, she said.

Heineken NV’s unit in Singapore, the maker of Tiger beer, had already committed to cut water usage by 20 percent even before the planned tariff increase, according to its head of corporate affairs, Mitchell Leow. About 95 percent of the beer is made out of water.

The company is working on a water reclamation project to process waste water for non-potable uses like general cleaning and for its brewery cooling towers, Leow said. Water consumption has been reduced by 4 percent since 2010 through initiatives such as harvesting rainwater from rooftops, he said.

From the government’s point of view, the pain of higher water prices is something businesses and consumers will have to bear as part of a broader goal of conserving the environment, said Euben Paracuelles, an economist at Nomura Holdings Inc. in Singapore.

“The signal from the government is that they want to conserve an important resource, and that for them is a bigger consideration than others,” Paracuelles said.

Finally. “Onshore North America used to be a market where state-of-the-art technology went to be humiliated,” said Tom Curran, an energy analyst at FBR Capital Markets & Co. “You’ve had a clear shift occur where onshore North America for the first time in recent history has become a technology play.”

The worst crude-market crash in a generation propelled energy companies into the digital world. They had already pretty much tested their physical limits with brute strength, ramping up injections of sand to tease more oil out of subterranean pockets and drilling wells longer and longer. Now they’re using DNA sequencing to track crude molecules and mapping buried streams with imaging software. Robots are fitting pipes together. Roughnecks consult mobile apps for drilling-direction advice. Oilfield services providers find themselves in a new arms race, led by giant Schlumberger Ltd., which recently opened an office on Sand Hill Road in the heart of Silicon Valley.

Real Revolution

It’s a real revolution, because many if not most explorers and drillers were stubbornly slow to look to software for help. They’ve historically been a conservative bunch. And during the good times of $100-a-barrel oil, profits were flowing so fast there wasn’t any incentive to experiment. The price plummeting to $50 since 2014 opened a lot of minds, starting a seismic shift to improve efficiency with data crunching and predictive analytics to get more out of rocks at less cost.

“The promise of oil and gas in the future is to actually start using the data that we have, and then acquire more of it and use more of it,” said Ashok Belani, executive vice president of technology at Schlumberger. “Data in the oil and gas industry has never been organized in the way that a company like Google or Amazon would do it.” And for all the recent progress, “we are in inning one of nine.”

There’s room for improvement in the business of exploration and extraction, particularly in the shale fields that are the most abundant sources left onshore. Recovery rates run about 8 percent. Getting to the targets requires fracturing oil-soaked rock with injections of water, sand and chemicals. That works about half the time.

Microbes in Rocks

So several companies, including Norway’s Statoil ASA and Houston-based Anadarko Petroleum Corp., have hired Biota Technology to help them identify the most bankable parcels. By comparing microbes in rock samples to those from oil produced in the area, Biota can map out choice draining spots and, according to founder Ajay Kshatriya, boost a well’s output by millions of dollars.

“It’s a whole new data source for an industry that’s never looked at this before,” said Kshatriya, an engineer who used to work in biotech. “New technology innovation is now existential. It’s not a nice-to-have to create a couple more points of profit margin. It’s, ‘If we don’t get more economic, our field is out of the money. So we need that technology to remain competitive.’ ”

EOG Resources Inc., an Enron Corp. castoff that is now the second largest independent U.S. oil explorer, has embraced big data analysis to such a degree that Wolfe Research analyst Paul Sankey called it “the best oil company we have ever covered.” The Houston-based company has, among other things, invented proprietary iPhone apps that field crews use to calculate how hard to frack particular stretches of crude-soaked rocks.

Autonomous Operations

The most important business stories of the day. Get Bloomberg's daily newsletter.

The industry is years away from fully embracing autonomous operations, said Binu Mathew, who was recruited seven months ago from Oracle Corp. to be the global head of digital for General Electric Co.’s oil and gas unit and works out of GE’s San Ramon, California, research center. The company is planning to roll out a new software suite in the third quarter that will pull in data from wells connected to the cloud.

There’s a lot of promise. A truly digital oilfield could lead to a 20 percent cut in primary preventative maintenance costs and a 2.5 percent boost to production volumes, according to GE estimates. With oil production in the U.S. is at 10 million barrels a day, that could mean a 231,000 barrel-a-day boost.

As it is, only 3 to 5 percent of all oil and gas assets -- including wells themselves and all the various equipment used to drill and frack and maintain production -- are connected digitally, according to GE. And of data collected, 97 percent is never used.

That seems to be on track to change fast. Over the next three to five years, 50 percent of oil and gas companies surveyed by Accenture Plc, a said they plan to boost spending on digital technologies. Investments are expected to focus increasingly on big data and mobile devices for roustabouts.

Disrupted Industry

As Mathew sees it, the oil industry is on its way to being disrupted, to use the Silicon Valley vernacular, in the way the auto industry has been. Self-driving cars are being tested around the country and could be on the market within a decade, and even the vehicles most Americans drive today are as dependent on processors as bolts and gears to function.

A $10 million oil well should have the same round-the-clock connectivity and self-help diagnostic capabilities as a $30,000 Chevrolet. To get to that point, energy companies “have to agree to work differently,” said Schlumberger’s Belani.

Oil-industry veterans and newly minted tech geeks work together in the two-story building that dutifully uphold Silicon Valley traditions, with a ping-pong table, bean-bag chairs, catered lunches and yoga classes.

“It’s really trying to bring that oilfield expertise and insert it into the mix of a Silicon Valley, digital-technology way of working,"" said Jan Smits, an engineer who is Schlumberger’s head of software technology. “That’s where the magic happens.”

2017-04-17 00:00:00,Robots May Help Build Your Next Home and Fill the Labor Gap,"‘This has to be the wave of the future,’ consultant says

The future of U.S. homebuilding depends on more people like Cyndicy Yarborough, a 26-year-old former Wal-Mart clerk with no background in construction.

At Blueprint Robotics in Baltimore, she works in a factory that builds houses like cars, on an assembly line, using robots that fire thousands of nails into studs each day and never miss. Yarborough operates a machine that lifts floors and walls and packs them onto a flatbed truck, the final step before delivery to a development site where they’ll be pieced together.

“I like being a part of something new, on the cutting edge,” said Yarborough, a single mother who took the job at Blueprint last May.

For all the concern over automation removing jobs from the workforce, companies like Blueprint are actually helping to ease a labor shortage that has crimped construction of residences and commercial properties across the country. The plants enable developers to fill the gap by having houses and apartment buildings manufactured off-site, for less money and in a fraction of the time. Even Marriott International Inc., the world’s biggest hotel operator, is increasingly turning to modular construction for some of its properties.

Giant Legos

To meet growing demand, high-tech plants are opening, and older factories that were shuttered after the last decade’s real estate crash -- many in areas such as rural Pennsylvania, where labor costs are cheap -- are being revived. Builders hire the factories to manufacture homes in sections, which are transported on trucks, then laid down on foundations by cranes, like giant Legos. Sometimes the modules are fully framed rooms, complete with tile showers and gourmet kitchens.

“This has to be the wave of the future -- I don’t know how we solve the labor shortage otherwise,” said John Burns, an Irvine, California-based homebuilding consultant. “What drives modular construction is the ability to build the house more cost-effectively.”

U.S. homebuilders say the labor crunch is their biggest challenge, and that it’s pushing costs up as much as 5.2 percent on average over 12 months, according to National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo surveys last year. President Donald Trump’s proposals to crack down on undocumented workers may further squeeze the industry, one heavily dependent on immigrant labor.

Confidence among U.S. homebuilders cooled in April after jumping a month earlier to the highest level since mid-2005, according to data released Monday by the National Association of Home Builders and Wells Fargo.

The idea of transporting homes in prefabricated sections has roots in the early 1900s, when homesteaders could buy kits from a Sears, Roebuck & Co. catalog for assembly on their newly acquired plots of land. In the 1980s and 1990s, it became increasingly popular to build lower-cost homes in factories, according to Gary Fleisher, who runs a blog for the industry called Modularhomecoach.com.

Mansions, Dorms

Today’s plants are capable of producing bigger buildings with more elaborate designs. The Blueprint factory in Baltimore is one of the first in the U.S. to use robots, Fleisher said. Taller multifamily buildings, dorms and hotels are increasingly being manufactured indoors. And so are mansions that sell for millions.

“Some builders won’t even advertise they work with modular companies like us,” said Myles Biggs, general manager of Ritz-Craft Corp.’s Pennsylvania construction facility. “You could be driving past a modular home and not even know it, because it looks just like one next door.”

Ritz-Craft can deliver a single-family house in six to eight weeks, on average. Having an indoor facility means weather delays are rarely a factor. Each worker is given a narrow concentration, like tiling floors or sanding drywall, which increases production speed. People without any background in construction can become skilled laborers in two weeks, according to Biggs.

Marriott’s Plans

The idea is catching on with Marriott, which aims to have agreements with North American developers this year to produce about 50 of its Select branded hotels in factories, said Karim Khalifa, senior vice president of global design strategies. In December, Marriott opened a Fairfield Inn in Folsom, California, with 97 rooms -- all built at a Guerdon Enterprises LLC plant in Boise, Idaho.

Last month, a collection of Marriott hotel rooms was getting wood-framed walls and ceilings at a Champion Homes factory in Liverpool, Pennsylvania. Even the beds and televisions will be in place before the boxes are shipped through stretches of highway and stacked in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, next month.

“What we like is how well modular is built,” Khalifa said. “These things have all been designed to be transported. They have the integrity of a shipping container.”

Apartment developers, too, are increasingly going with modular construction, especially in fast-growing cities such as Denver and Nashville, Tennessee, said Rich Rozycki, head of Champion Homes’ commercial division, which has seen its pipeline grow 50 percent since 2014. The company also has had discussions with national homebuilders looking for a solution to their labor problems, he said.

Cheaper Labor

Labor costs are more favorable for factory construction, according to David Reed, vice president of Champion’s modular division. Workers make about $15 to $20 an hour in rural Pennsylvania. That compares with $50 to $100 an hour in the markets the manufacturers serve, like New York’s Hudson Valley, and the Washington, D.C., area, Reed said.

Builder Kris Megna works with Champion to create houses as large as 10,000 square feet (930 square meters) in the pricey suburbs of Boston. Megna, 31, who founded Dreamline Modular Homes in 2010, said almost any custom design is possible, even though the modules can’t be much bigger than 60 feet by 16 feet (18 meters by 5 meters). Walls between sections can be knocked down for open-concept kitchens, and cutouts can create vaulted ceilings, he said.

“The house is 60 percent complete when it arrives, and that means 60 percent of the headaches of building are gone,” Megna said.

Industry Stigma

For less-expensive homes with smaller margins for developers, transportation costs can eat up the savings of going modular. Federal restrictions also limit the size of each box, or section of home being moved, which can mean more on-site construction. There’s also the stigma, modular manufacturers say, that connects them to the industry’s oldest relative.

“Often when we exhibit a model home at trade shows, I will hear comments like ‘This is nice for a trailer,’” said Biggs of Ritz-Craft. “Our homes are far from it, and in many ways higher-quality than those built on site.”

There doesn’t seem to be any stigma for customers of Connecticut Valley Homes, a builder that assembles factory-made components on lots in New England, including near the stately mansions of Greenwich. The East Lyme-based firm is “booming at moment,” with deposits for 42 houses, up about 50 percent from the same time last year, said Dave Cooper, senior building consultant. The company built only eight homes in 2011, when the housing market was hitting bottom.

“Coming out of the recession, the labor pool is just lacking,” Cooper said. “Kids are not going to construction trade school any more -- they’re all playing on their computers.”

Blueprint’s Robots

That isn’t necessarily a problem for Jerry Smalley, chief executive officer of Blueprint, the Baltimore factory. He’s even taking well-trained electricians and plumbers with decades of experience and putting them in front of computer screens. The company’s German-made robots are more precise than humans could ever be, using techniques that Western Europeans have employed for years, according to Smalley.

“Robots cut the hole,” he said. “But somebody still has to put the electrical box and pipes in the right places.”

Instead of displacing workers -- a usual side effect of automation -- Blueprint’s machines are creating opportunities for people like Yarborough, who wouldn’t otherwise be a part of the homebuilding industry. On the factory floors, 29 production workers are operating machines that cut, sand, drill and insulate. A milling center with several different options for blades, caged in safety glass, gets to work after an employee -- no hard hat needed -- uploads a file that tells it exactly what to do.

Yarborough said she’s not interested in learning more about traditional construction. Before joining Blueprint, she took a free, six-month course on computer numerical control machines, available only to unemployed or low-income adults.

“I’m more interested in the engineering side,” she said, adding that she’d like to be a part of the team that generates the design maps used by robots on the factory floor. “I want to end up upstairs.”"
2017-04-13 00:00:00,United Disaster Over Passenger Removal and How Not to Respond to Crisis,"1) How Not to Handle a Crisis

Remember the firestorm over that Pepsi ad featuring Kendall Jenner handing a can of Pepsi to a cop during a protest? Funny how quickly the blowback died when company apologized and pulled it. The United Airlines story, on the other hand, won’t go away, thanks in no small part to the company’s bungled response. First, a widely mocked statement that sounded like it was written by lawyers, using words like “re-accommodate.” Then, United blamed the customer, or in this case, the passenger, saying he was “disruptive” and “belligerent.” Kara Alaimo, who teaches public relations at Hofstra University, wrote for Bloomberg View that this was the statement that should have been issued immediately:

All of us at United were horrified by what happened on Flight 3411 last night. We have reached out to the passenger to apologize, offer assistance and make amends. Nothing is more important to United than the safety of our passengers. This incident doesn’t reflect our values and we’re going to make sure it never happens again.

Video of the incident was tweeted midday on Sunday, but it wasn’t until Tuesday that United released a statement from Chief Executive Oscar Munoz saying that he would “deeply apologize to the customer forcibly removed and to all the customers aboard.”

2) It’s Time to Worry About the U.S. Supreme Court Again

After weeks of drama over the U.S. Supreme Court, time to focus on law for a bit. Right? Nope. Justice Neil Gorsuch has just been sworn in, but already people are talking about the battle over the next vacant seat on the nation’s highest court. Rumors are swirling about the tenure of Justice Anthony Kennedy, a Reagan appointee whose vote often decides politically charged cases. He is planning to hold a reunion of his law clerks in June. That’s notable because he usually holds one every five years, but this gathering is coming a year ahead of that timetable. Kennedy hasn’t tipped his hand, and a spokeswoman said the reunion in late June, rather than mid-June before the court's term is over, just worked best with his schedule.

3) Bragging About Being a Genius Can Cost You Millions in Divorce Court

He built a $225 million fortune in finance, working for private equity. But a U.K. panel of judges said Randy Work didn’t deserve anything more than the traditional 50-50 split of assets in the divorce battle with his wife of 20 years, Mandy Gray. Work said that he deserved 61 percent of the pie because he made millions using “groundbreaking methodologies” in debt markets. The argument that one party in a marriage made a “special contribution” to the couple’s wealth has only worked a handful of times in U.K. court, including in the 2005 divorce of WPP CEO Martin Sorrell, who won 60 percent of £75 million ($94 million). In fact, the court said Work’s genius argument was “unhelpful” to his case.

4) Wall Street Has Completely Bought Into the Electric Car

Photographer: Brian Schildhorn/Bloomberg

Tesla Inc. became the most valuable car company in America this week, passing General Motors Co. The company’s market cap rose to nearly $60 billion, just topping that of GM (it has since slid back). It’s a remarkable run for a company that has delivered fewer than 200,000 cars, in a nation that buys more than 17 million a year. Bloomberg’s David Welch writes that the rise shows how much investors have “bought into Musk’s vision that electric vehicles will eventually rule the road.” But is the company worth it? GM is expected to earn $9 billion this year. Ford’s number may top $6 billion. Tesla? It’s expected to lose almost $1 billion.

5) Taxes in the U.S. Are Nowhere Near the Highest in the World

Just in time for the annual IRS tax deadline comes a new analysis showing that the U.S. is nowhere near the top of a list of countries when it comes to income taxes. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said a slew of European countries carve off a higher percentage of residents’ income, although the analysis didn’t include other types of taxes, such as property or sales taxes. Belgium took the biggest chunk—54 percent of the salary of a non-married worker. In the U.S., it’s 32 percent."
2017-04-12 00:00:00,China's Silk Road Push in Pakistan Edges Out U.S. Investments,"China is overtaking the U.S. as the largest direct foreign investor to Pakistan, with the South Asian nation increasingly favoring its neighbor’s “One Belt, One Road” trade route that’s funneling in billions of dollars and revamping decrepit infrastructure.

With relations frayed between the U.S. and Pakistan, China has been strengthening its ties to the nation of about 200 million people after it pledged two years ago to loan and finance about $55 billion in a so-called China-Pakistan Economic Corridor. U.S. direct investment in Pakistan stood at $505 million from July 2013 through January this year, compared with $1.82 billion that came from neighboring China, according to central bank data.

“As the U.S. looks inward, China is reaching out,” said Bilal Khan, a senior economist at Standard Chartered Plc in Karachi. “Against this backdrop, the U.S. could steadily loose its share in FDI to Pakistan as China’s rises.”

It’s part of Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif’s plan to boost economic growth to the highest in about a decade. For the Chinese, the Silk Road plan aims to revive trade across Central Asia and into Europe via a network of railways, ports and highways.

Beijing is also increasing its corporate footprint in Pakistan, with a record 77 Chinese companies registered in the South Asian nation during the last three years, according to the Securities and Exchange Commission in Islamabad.

Even the cash coming in from the U.S. isn’t fresh and is usually reinvestments from companies already based in Pakistan, such as tobacco company Philip Morris International Inc.’s $105 million injection of funds to improve manufacturing facilities and install new machinery last year.

This is despite large multinational firms, such as Proctor & Gamble Co. and General Electric Co., having a foothold in the country -- the latter in January supplied seven locomotives to Pakistan Railways as part of a $400 million 10-year deal for the eventual purchase of 55 train units.

“We are not on their radar,” M. Abdul Aleem, chief executive officer of the Karachi-based Overseas Chamber of Commerce and Industry, which represents 195 foreign firms, including 31 from the U.S., said of American investors. “They tend to stay away when it comes to Pakistan.”

At The Crossroad

The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor lies “right at the crossroad” of two major networks China is building, said Chen Fengying, an expert on global economy with the China Institute of Contemporary International Relations.

Bilateral investment has grown rapidly also because the two countries have built up trust over the years, she said. “Pakistan is the only country being called as an “all-weather strategic partner’ by the Chinese government, signaling a sense of unwavering support under all conditions.”

China’s government plans to hold a summit, called the Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation, in Beijing in May involving about 20 heads of state.

Meanwhile, political analysts say there is more than simple economics to the recent slowdown in U.S. investment in Pakistan. Shaista Tabassum, chairwoman of the international relations department at the University of Karachi, said the two countries are moving further apart.

“It is moving slowly down,” Tabassum said about the two nations’ relations. “CPEC has many economic benefits coming, which Pakistan expected the United States should have given to it.”

Strained Relations

Ties between the countries have long been uneasy and complex -- Pakistan is accused of harboring militants carrying out attacks in neighboring Afghanistan and India, and the U.S. has demanded it take action. Pakistan has consistently denied using proxy forces to influence foreign policy objectives.

There are also concerns U.S. President Donald Trump may cut economic and military funding to Pakistan, which is the sixth largest recipient of American aid. Trump’s fiscal 2018 budget proposal -- entitled “America First” -- called for “deep cuts” to foreign assistance with a 28.5 percent funding reduction for international programs, including the State Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development.

However, Pakistan’s central bank chief spokesman Abid Qamar said in an interview in Karachi that China’s confidence and inflows into Pakistan will encourage others.

“We expect CPEC related economic activities will in fact revive the interest of foreign investors in Pakistan,” he said."
2017-04-11 00:00:00,Tesla Seeks Independent Directors as Board's Musk Ties Eyed,"Tesla Inc. said it’s searching for independent directors as an influential group of investors pressures the electric-car maker’s board to add two members who don’t have ties to Elon Musk.

Five of Musk’s six fellow board members have personal or professional connections to the Tesla chief executive officer, which could jeopardize their independence, the California State Teachers’ Retirement System and four other investors wrote in a letter Monday to Tesla’s lead independent director. The managers of a combined $721 billion in assets also pushed for yearly director elections, rather than votes staggered every three years.

“Directors should be held to a higher standard of independence given the conflicts of interest that permeate this board,” the letter to Tesla director Antonio Gracias said. “A thoroughly independent board would provide a critical check on possible dysfunctional group dynamics, such as groupthink.”

The push is a signal that longstanding concerns with Tesla’s boardroom remain even as the company’s shares soar. Investors took issue with directors’ ties to the CEO during the lead-up to last year’s merger with SolarCity Corp. Musk’s cousins ran the money-losing solar-panel installer, and he owned more than 20 percent of both businesses. Pressure to strengthen management oversight is rising as Tesla’s market value climbs and rivals some of the world’s biggest automakers.

Tesla will “soon” announce two new independent board members and has been planning this since the SolarCity merger, Musk said Wednesday on Twitter. “This group has nothing to do with it,” he said in a tweet, referring to the investor group.

A Tesla spokesman on Tuesday said the company is “actively engaged in a search process” for the new board members, adding that “we regularly engage with our shareholders and value their feedback.”

Tesla has yet to publish the proxy for its upcoming annual meeting. In correspondence with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Palo Alto, California-based company has indicated a proposal for annual director elections from the Connecticut Retirement Plans and Trust Funds will be voted on this year. The Connecticut funds are among the investors who signed the letter to Gracias, along with Calstrs, the second-largest U.S. pension fund.

‘Still Concerns’

“Getting independent people on the board is important in terms of holding management accountable,” Etelvina Martinez, the corporate governance manager at CtW Investment Group, which also signed the letter, said in a phone interview. “Shareholders need to be able to hold management accountable. While the stock price is doing extremely well, there are still concerns about corporate governance.”

The most important business stories of the day. Get Bloomberg's daily newsletter.

Tesla’s board is comprised of Musk, his brother, Kimbal Musk; Gracias, the founder of a private-equity firm and a director at Musk’s rocket company SpaceX; Ira Ehrenpreis, a venture capitalist and SpaceX investor; Brad Buss, a former SolarCity chief financial officer; Steve Jurvetson, a venture investor and SpaceX director; and Robyn Denholm, the chief operating officer of Telstra Corp., Australia’s largest telecommunications company.

Musk is Tesla’s largest shareholder, with a stake of almost 21 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Gracias is the sixth-biggest, with a 3.75 percent stake.

Investors’ Influence

While the pension funds behind the letter don’t have large positions in Tesla on their own, they’re influential among other institutional investors.

Calstrs was one of the founding members of the Investor Stewardship Group, which assembled major fund managers to set corporate governance goals in January. The group, whose members include BlackRock Inc., State Street Corp., Vanguard Group and T. Rowe Price Group, generally backs annual board elections to increase accountability to shareholders.

“As companies grow up and mature, they need to have governance practices that reflect that,” Philip Larrieu, an associate portfolio manager for Calstrs, said in a phone interview. “When the stock is doing well, the argument is ’we don’t need to make changes, we are doing well. But we will push for these changes regardless of the stock price.”

Annual Elections

Investors have pushed companies broadly over the past few decades to move to more frequent director elections. Less than 11 percent of S&P 500 companies have staggered board elections today, down from 32 percent in 2011, according to governance-data provider Equilar.

At annual meetings last year, ten proposals seeking declassified boards received 80 percent support from shareholders on average, according to data compiled by Fundvotes.com.

Tesla shares have climbed 44 percent this year, valuing the company at more than $50.3 billion. The company’s market capitalization was $5.4 billion higher than Ford Motor Co. and trailed General Motors Co. by about $461 million as of Tuesday’s close.

“If Tesla truly wants to be forward-thinking, then it needs to embrace accountability and it needs to welcome diverse, independent opinions into its boardroom,” New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer said in an emailed statement. “Strong performance doesn’t insulate Tesla from accountability.”"

Good afternoon. No U.S. company ranks among the top five automakers in terms of market cap, but GM and Tesla elbowed each other around in the sixth and seventh positions today. Investors seem to be coming around to Elon Musk's vision of an electric car future, although the much smaller Tesla has a long way to go before being as profitable as its century-old competitor. –Emily Banks

Tesla passed GM to become the top U.S. carmaker. Tesla climbed as much as 3.7 percent in early Monday trading, boosting its market capitalization to $51 billion. The company was valued at about $1.7 billion more than GM as of 9:35 a.m. in New York and the two jostled for the lead spot in subsequent trading. Tesla has long been treated like a technology stock with investors betting on its ability to dominate a market for electric cars and energy storage. To those same investors, GM and Ford are headed for a slowdown in car sales that will erode profits.

Wells Fargo’s board clawed back $28 million from former CEO John Stumpf and canceled about $47 million of ex-community bank head Carrie Tolstedt’s stock options after determining they were among senior managers who failed to heed warnings of spreading sales abuses for more than a decade. The bank’s executives treated thousands of fired employees as rogues, and then downplayed the mounting terminations as the board began raising questions, according to the results of a six-month probe by a panel of independent directors.

2017-04-10 00:00:00,Icahn Spat Leads to Billion-Dollar Fortune for Gas Pioneer Souki,"Charif Souki, co-founder and chairman of Tellurian Inc., speaks at the Gastech Exhibition & Conference in Chiba, Japan, on Tuesday, April 4, 2017.

Charif Souki has been chasing his fortune in the energy business for two decades. It took getting fired by billionaire Carl Icahn for him to hit paydirt.

Icahn kicked Souki out of Cheniere Energy Inc. in December 2015 after a dispute over the company’s export strategy. Souki, who was Cheniere’s chief executive officer, resurfaced two months later with a company called Tellurian and a plan to produce 5 percent of the world’s liquefied natural gas by 2025.

Investors cheered, bidding up publicly traded Tellurian Inc., which has valued Souki’s 27.5 percent stake at $646 million. That, along with $325 million in Cheniere share sales and cash salary and bonuses since 1998, plus the piece of Cheniere stock he held onto, gives him a net worth of $1 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.

“Souki’s always been somewhat of a visionary,” said Vello A. Kuuskraa, president of Advanced Resources International Inc., an energy consulting firm in Arlington, Virginia. “Sometimes he’s ahead of the game, but in general the world always catches up with him.”

“Please don’t take it personally,” Souki said in an April 6 voice message. “But I really don’t want to comment on my personal situation.” Icahn was unavailable to comment for this story, according to his office.

Icahn Faceoff

When Icahn began amassing a 13.9 percent stake in Cheniere in 2015, Souki had already shifted the company’s focus twice. A former investment banker, he started the business in 1996 to produce oil and gas. In 2001, he turned to building an import terminal to keep up with demand for natural gas. That strategy ran right into the U.S. fracking boom that flooded the market with supply and drove prices to new lows. By the time Icahn arrived, Souki was chasing exports.

Amid a weakening oil market and fears of LNG oversupply, Souki advocated doubling Cheniere’s export capacity, leading Icahn, the world’s 38th-richest person with a $19.4 billion fortune, to pressure the board to push him out.

Ranked by Bloomberg in 2014 as the highest-paid U.S. executive, Souki said he was going back to Aspen, Colorado, to become a ski bum. Two months later, Cheniere’s first LNG shipment left port and Souki resurfaced with Tellurian, which he took public through a reverse merger with publicly traded oil producer Magellan Petroleum Corp.

Asian Demand

Funded mainly by Total SA and General Electric, Tellurian announced plans for a Louisiana facility that when completed in 2025 will be able to export 26 million metric tons of LNG annually, according to a March presentation. Driving demand is Asia, the world’s largest LNG market, which Souki anticipates growing at an annual rate of 3.9 percent. Souki’s goal is to meet that demand with gas that is liquefied more cheaply than at Cheniere, according to Madeline Jowdy, senior director of global gas and LNG at Pira Energy Group in New York.

Born in Egypt in 1953, Souki was raised in Lebanon where his father was a Newsweek correspondent, according to a 2013 Foreign Affairs profile. He attended Colgate University and received his MBA from Columbia University, and became wealthy from his work as an investment banker where his fluency in French and Arabic positioned him as a deal maker in Europe and the Middle East.

O.J. Connection

Tired of chasing other people’s money, he left banking and moved to Aspen, Colorado, indulging a passion for skiing he developed as a boy in Lebanon. He began investing in the restaurant business, eventually building a portfolio of eateries there and in Los Angeles, where he moved in 1993.

One of them, a trendy Brentwood hotspot called Mezzaluna, rocketed to infamy a year later when Nicole Brown Simpson and waiter Ron Goldman were killed after Simpson had dined there with her family. Football star O.J. Simpson was tried for the killings and acquitted in October 1995. Souki told Bloomberg Businessweek in 2015 that he was astonished at the lack of decency the resulting frenzy revealed. He closed the restaurant in 1997.

He was lured into the exploration business by the promise 3D mapping technology offered and is now leading a team at Tellurian that’s responsible for over 20 percent of the world’s existing LNG production.

“I met him when he had that heretical idea of importing LNG, and I’ve followed his career very closely,” said Anatol Feygin, chief commercial officer at Cheniere Energy, in a phone call. “He’s been instrumental in creating Cheniere and creating the U.S. LNG business model. He is responsible for this revolution as much as any one individual.”"
2017-04-07 00:00:00,Ohio State's Endowment Gets $1 Billion With Campus Energy Deal,"Ohio State University’s endowment will jump 25 percent in size with a $1 billion payment from two companies that will lease the school’s energy assets for 50 years.

The school’s board of trustees on Friday approved a public-private partnership with French company Engie SA and Montreal-based Axium Infrastructure Inc. to run and manage its energy and electricity systems in exchange for annual payments expected to exceed $54 million.

The most important market news of the day. Get our markets daily newsletter.

Research universities like Ohio State are akin to small towns, with large holdings of buildings to maintain for decades. Colleges are grappling with how to become more energy efficient at a time of budget cutbacks and lagging endowment performance. Ohio State, which has struggled with long-term performance in its fund, said the deal will lower energy costs and the payment will help bolster academic programs.

Upfront payments are common in public-private partnerships that involve existing assets, said Rick Geddes, director of Cornell University’s program in infrastructure policy.

“It’s inherently less risky, because you kind of know the revenues of the assets already,” Geddes said. “It’s how you use the payment -- that’s the risk.”

Columbus-based Ohio State in 2012 also entered into a 50-year lease to manage its parking operations in an almost $500 million deal with an upfront payment that went into its endowment.

Such deals have sometimes attracted opposition, in part because they tend to be complicated, and because not all deals have been financially beneficial. With a parking meter deal in Chicago, for instance, its inspector general determined that the city, in its rush to fill a short-term budget gap, undersold the rights.

Ohio State’s parking deal helped the school distribute about $100 million to endeavors including scholarships, sustainable transportation options and faculty positions, according to the school.

Fee Structure

The deal with Engie and Axium has multiple parts. The school will pay the companies an annual fee that starts at $45 million and increases 1.5 percent per year; an operating fee that starts at $9.2 million annually and can be adjusted based on costs; and a financial return on any capital investments it funds for the university.

The university will pay Engie and Axium more than $2.7 billion over the life of the contract, which officials contend wouldn’t exceed what it would otherwise pay.

“Like many universities, we have an interest in sustaining and using our energy resources in an efficient and also responsible way,” Michael Drake, the school’s president, said in an interview.

The companies will install energy conservation measures after evaluating some 450 buildings and 22 million-square-feet of energy-related infrastructure on campus. Some of the improvements include heat recovery and demand-controlled ventilation.

About 20 percent of the campus is powered by wind, which potentially could increase. The university will save on capital improvements costs, estimated to be less than if the school tackled the projects on its own, said Geoffrey Chatas, OSU’s chief financial officer.

The payment to Ohio State will push its endowment up one spot to the sixth richest public school through June 30, surpassing Pennsylvania State University, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It was the 25th-largest U.S. endowment as of that period with $3.6 billion.

The fund is up 5.3 percent for the first six months of fiscal 2017 to $3.9 billion, buoyed by its 43 percent in public equities.

For the long-term, its performance is among the worst of the largest 100 college funds, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

Its 3.7 percent annualized 10-year return lags the 5 percent average gain for about 800 funds of all sizes, according to a survey by the National Association of College and University Business Officers and money manager CommonFund. Ohio State’s 5-year return is 5 percent, below Nacubo’s 5.4 percent average.

“We’re not where we want to be,” Chatas said.

The school sought better returns by hiring its first chief investment officer in 2008. The investment office was staffed by fiscal 2010, and the fund’s annualized return since then was 8.1 percent through June 30. John Lane, the second CIO, joined in 2014.

Chatas said the school estimates an annualized 8 percent return over the next decade in the endowment. The $1 billion payment will be invested in the fund’s long-term strategy, which includes an increase to its current allocation of 16.5 percent to private equity, where the endowment has been recruiting staff, he said.

Tim Keating, president of Keating Wealth Management, an investment adviser based in Greenwood Village, Colorado, said achieving high returns in a low-return environment will be challenging.

“The default assumption should be their historical return, not their projected return,” Keating said."
2017-04-04 00:00:00,GE Sees 15% Boost by 2020 in Brazil Aircraft-Engine Service Unit,"General Electric Co.’s Brazilian operation overhauling aircraft engines is poised to expand 15 percent by 2020 even as the country’s economy continues to sputter.

The U.S. company’s Celma unit will handle 550 engines in three years from the current level of 480, said General Manager Julio Talon. Celma’s sales have doubled over the last seven years to $2 billion as the operation catered to international customers such as Southwest Airlines Co., American Airlines Group Inc., and FedEx Corp.

“I bring a jet engine or a part from anywhere in the world in five days,’’ Talon said in an interview in Rio de Janeiro’s International Brazil Air Show. “In 65 days, the engine is back with my customer after being serviced. This is 15 to 20 days faster than any competitor.”

Talon has added 100 mechanics annually during the last six years to maintain, repair and overhaul the engines, connecting with prospective employees through a partnership with the social-service arm of Brazil’s Industry Federation. That kind of hiring is a rarity in a country where the economy has contracted two years in a row and the jobless rate rose to a record 13.2 percent in the three months through February.

The competitiveness of the GE operation is taking a blow as the Brazilian government ended a payroll tax break in an effort to meet budget targets. As a result, Petropolis, Brazil-based Celma faces a 6 percent increase in labor cost.

“My competition is in China or Malaysia,’’ Talon said. “Tax incentives can’t be applied as short-term policies.’’"
2017-04-05 00:00:00,How ETFs Are Transforming Fixed Income,"Leighton Shantz had barely begun managing part of the $26 billion pension fund for Texas state employees when he got a crazy idea.

The fund’s floundering investment-grade bond portfolio was occupying his undivided attention, its strategy clearly broken. No matter what he tried, the securities couldn’t deliver sufficient yield or liquidity. He knew he had to get rid of them; he just wasn’t sure how. The time-tested rules for fixed income, which Shantz had honed for years as a managing director at Lockheed Martin Investment Management Co. and as a money manager for Tennessee’s retirement system for teachers and state employees, no longer seemed to apply.

As he analyzed the broader portfolio over the summer of 2012, it dawned on him that exchange-traded funds, which were becoming increasingly popular investing tools, might prove useful. These funds needed thousands of securities just to exist. Perhaps they could take the bonds off his hands? Yet whenever ETFs came up in conversation with asset managers, they responded how a Texan might react to finding beans in his chili. “Every one of them commented on how stupid bond ETFs are,” says Shantz, 51. That response didn’t sit especially well with the contrarian. “I decided that either fixed-­income ETFs were truly sensationally stupid—which didn’t explain why their assets were growing so fast—or there was much more to it.”

This story appears in the April/May 2017 issue of Bloomberg Markets. Cover artwork: Steve Caldwell

Shantz and his team of six began studying the funds. What they found intrigued them—so much so that in May 2013 Shantz forked over $1.35 billion of debt, or almost 20 percent of the fixed-income book, in exchange for shares in two of BlackRock’s investment-grade bond ETFs. It was a bold move for the Employees Retirement System of Texas, an institution that had only one small trade in bond ETFs under its belt when Shantz joined. When he later explained the maneuver at an industry event, peers and competitors told him that he was risking his reputation and that he’d gone mad. “They were absolutely convinced that I was a fool,” he says. “In a market dislocation, [they said,] these things would blow up, leaving me in a smoking heap in the ditch.”

That wasn’t just fear of the unknown. When the U.S. housing bubble burst in the mid-2000s, the price of some ETFs diverged sharply from the value of their underlying bonds. Given that these funds had since become more sophisticated and complex, some wondered whether they could walk through the fire of a global financial crisis. But Shantz and his portfolio have yet to find said ditch. Indeed, they’re both alive and well, with the credit book returning an annualized 5.3 percent over the last three years, beating its benchmark by 60 basis points. “It wasn’t until it was all done that you could breathe in and go, ‘Well, that was awesome,’ ” he says.

And the once-esoteric debt ETFs he used? They’re colonizing swaths of investor money that bonds used to rule alone. In pension plans, endowments, and mutual funds, they’ve grown as liquid alternatives to cash and temporary holding pens for capital, and as trading tools. Bond ETFs around the world are swimming in more than $700 billion of cash, with about $480 billion of that in the U.S. Although those sums are a drop in the bucket compared with equity ETFs, which account for about 80 percent of the $2.8 trillion U.S. market, debt funds are growing at a faster clip than all asset classes other than commodities.

Every bond powerhouse from Pacific Investment Management Co. to DoubleLine Capital has started funds to get in on the action. More shares in a BlackRock high-yield debt ETF were traded on its busiest day last year than shares in Wal-Mart Stores, Exxon Mobil, or American International Group during the same session. By ­contrast, similar bonds typically trade fewer than 100 times a day.

This rapid explosion of “Debt 2.0” has spurred dislocations and mutations in the market. Regulators worry that ETF brokers can’t keep pace with investor appetite for the funds. Some ETFs flirt with allowing cheaper assets into their portfolios so they grow faster than their competitors. And the products are getting more and more complex. But none of this has slowed their acceptance by the financial community. “It’s gone viral,” Shantz says.





Turning bond ETFs into the next Grumpy Cat was far from Stephen Laipply’s mind when he got the call from Texas in early 2013. Laipply had welcomed Shantz to BlackRock’s San Francisco office a few weeks before and was impressed by the fund manager’s thoughtful questions about ETFs. Now Shantz was back with a proposal.

A flood of easy money spilling out from the Federal Reserve had lifted company debt almost 10 percent in 2012, according to the Bloomberg Barclays US Corporate Bond Index. Investors had two ways to join the party via ETFs: They could either buy shares from existing owners on the stock market, the way they would with Apple Inc. or General Electric Co., or they could ask the ETF manager to create new shares for them. To create shares, an investor could pay in cash or “in kind,” acquiring and delivering an agreed-upon smorgasbord of securities to the fund, which the fund would then absorb and use to support the issuance. A middleman, usually a bank or broker, facilitated the switch.

Shantz wanted to explore an innovative version of the second route: using his book of investment-grade debt to buy the shares. Laipply had seen this type of portfolio trade only once before, nine months earlier, when he’d swapped 4,000 bonds from a large pension fund for shares in BlackRock’s flagship ETFs. He started picking through Shantz’s selection of securities to determine which bonds might fit into their ETFs. “There were hundreds of bonds,” Laipply says. “We went through a process of just looking at the potential candidates and seeing how they could map onto our ETFs.”

Those names were then sent to BlackRock fund managers, who made the final call on whether to accept or reject the offerings. A little more than half the bonds were a match. Elated, Shantz handed over the debt in exchange for shares in two ­investment-grade ETFs. Just like that, step one was complete.

But for Shantz, that wasn’t the end. The pension plan needed bonds, not these ETFs, and he’d settled on a mix of junk debt and Treasuries. So after lying low for three months, Shantz quietly arranged step two: selling the ETFs in the secondary market to exit his position and free up capital. By October he’d halved his exposure. By December the shares were gone. Shantz had his cash—and all without roiling the price of the ETFs. “We didn’t want to show up every day looking for bids,” he says. “You can go into ETFs and buy or sell exposure in size and never tip your hand to anybody.”

That versatility is part of what makes ETFs an attractive proposition for money managers frustrated with the clubby world of traditional debt trading. Rules implemented after the financial crisis have crushed the banks and brokers that previously oversaw bond trades, curbing their inventories and manpower and making large trades a laborious process that nimbler competitors can exploit.

ETFs offer a speedier, cheaper alternative. The difference between the price at which traders are willing to buy or sell a mainstream junk-bond ETF is about 1 basis point, considerably less than a spread of about 45 basis points to trade the underlying basket of bonds. The fee to create ETF shares is typically less than $1,000. In tumultuous markets, the funds are a safe house for investors, allowing them to remove baskets of bonds from their balance sheets in return for highly tradable equity instruments that they can switch back into debt when markets calm down. Others buy ETFs to earn income on capital they’re waiting to allocate elsewhere. And still more follow Shantz’s example and use ETFs as a tool to adjust their portfolios. “It’s happening every day at some level and in some form,” says Damon Walvoord, co-head of the ETF group at Susquehanna International Group LLP. “It still has a long way to go before it’s an everyday tool for bond managers, but it’s moving in that direction.”





Fixed-income portfolio managers can use {BSKT <GO>} to find liquidity by exchanging bonds for ETF shares.



Such a dramatic transformation of the debt market brings challenges as well as opportunities. Regulators fear that share creations could falter if even one or two middlemen who lead these trades quit. The Securities and Exchange Commission needs to review the role of these gatekeepers, Commissioner Kara Stein has said.

Difficulties sourcing debt to create ETF shares and managing that risk—particularly overnight—have already pushed some middlemen to stick to cash creations or hand over tricky requests to their competitors. The likes of Susquehanna have dedicated bond ETF traders, but debt and equity teams at some other shops remain divided. The creation process they administer—which is unique to ETFs as an asset class—is also fragmented. Although some bond ETFs demand a basket of securities already found in the fund, others require a portfolio of debt that’s merely similar. The latter makes for a more liquid ETF that’s easier to create, particularly for portfolio trades, but it also incentivizes submitting the cheapest qualifying securities to the fund. ETF managers wanting to increase their assets must walk a fine line between accepting them and diverging too far from their mandate. “We’re evaluating them very closely, but the execution potentially is not as good as doing it yourself,” says Gregory Peters, who runs the ­Prudential Total Return Bond Fund. “I’m not an ETF hater by any stretch of the imagination, but those are some of the challenges we face as an active bond manager implementing ETFs into the strategy.”

Many other money managers have made their peace with debt ETFs and are weaving them deeper into their books. BlackRock gained 64 institutional users of its bond ETFs last year, while almost 70 percent of the 100 pension funds, insurers, and ­investment advisers surveyed for a Greenwich Associates LLC report last September said they’d increased their use of the funds over the previous three years. Investors that have already embraced portfolio trades are now utilizing ETFs in lieu of options, swaps, and futures. Instead of entering total-return swaps, they’re finding similar exposure in an ETF. And rather than using credit default swaps, investors are hedging their debt holdings with help from options on ETFs. Exchange-traded funds have also allowed ­investors to bet against entire markets rather than short individual securities. The funds are typically cheaper and require less ­balance sheet space or collateral than buying a derivative.

All of that seems a world away from the stakes Shantz faced using ETFs in 2013. Then, his reputation was on the line; now he uses them almost casually to respond to the needs of his ­portfolio—instantly boosting exposure to a hot sector or ditching a clutch of unattractive bonds. “There are some people who aren’t that bright and would rather fail unconventionally than muddle along conventionally,” he says. “I guess I’m one of those.”

2017-04-04 00:00:00,U.S. Car Demand Collapse Jeopardizes Trump's Auto Factory Push,"‘You’re not going to see’ new U.S. car plants, consultant says

Ford Fusion: down 37 percent. Chevrolet Malibu: down 36 percent. Toyota Prius: down 29 percent.

As those grim numbers suggest, the U.S. auto industry was blindsided last month by just how fast sedans have fallen out of favor with Americans now embracing roomier sport utility vehicles. Family-friendly crossovers may be more profitable, but the quick shift is causing headaches.

The swerve in consumer taste is just one of the forces -- along with slumping used-car values and a pullback in subprime auto lending -- that are changing the equation for manufacturers as President Donald Trump leans on the industry to build new plants and boost hiring. That’ll be hard to pull off: A glut of both new and used vehicles on the market has sparked an incentives battle, meaning new production lines are the last thing the companies need.

Industrywide deliveries in March were supposed to show a rebound following small dips in January and February. But the annualized sales pace, adjusted for seasonal trends, slowed to 16.6 million vehicles, from 16.7 million a year earlier, according to researcher Autodata Corp. Analysts had projected the rate would accelerate to about 17.2 million.

Automakers set a record in the U.S. last year, with 17.6 million vehicles sold.

“I’ve been expecting a slowdown for a while,” said Morningstar Inc. analyst David Whiston. “It shouldn’t be a surprise. Once you hit peak sales, it seems like you only have bad news ahead.”

Ample discounts have failed to spur demand for models like General Motors Co.’s Chevrolet Malibu and Ford Motor Co.’s Fusion, which are being surpassed by crossovers as the new American family vehicle of choice. The Toyota Prius sedan model continued its slump despite a thorough makeover in late 2015 that improved the staid hybrid’s ride.

Crossover Sales

In March, sales of crossovers including the Chevrolet Equinox and Ford Escape were up 11 percent, while mid-size cars like the Fusion fell 16 percent, according to Woodcliff Lake, New Jersey-based Autodata.

SUVs are keeping profits afloat. Cheap gasoline and more efficient engines are allowing buyers to get into the bigger people-movers they love. With an average sticker price of more than $38,000, a truck or SUV costs about $10,000 more than the average car. The incentives needed to sell them amount to an 8.8 percent discount, compared with 11 percent for cars, according to Edmunds.com, an industry research firm.

The problem is that even popular SUVs need more and more incentives to keep sales moving.

“Higher incentives have pushed demand about as far as it can go,” Joe Spak, an auto analyst with RBC Capital Markets, wrote in a report Monday.

Share Declines

While the pace of overall auto sales is plenty for companies to make money, investors aren’t buying. The March figures hit carmakers hard, with GM falling 3.4 percent and Ford declining 1.7 percent on Monday. AutoNation Inc., the nation’s largest car dealer, dropped 3.4 percent.

The one U.S. automaker to see its shares rise was Tesla Inc., whose upcoming mass-market Model 3 sedan gives the company a shot a real growth. The electric-car maker’s market capitalization surged past Ford for the first time.

For the auto industry’s incumbents, inventories are high and incentives are at near-record levels. That’s prompting companies to spend more on discounts just to stay close to 2016’s record results. Jessica Caldwell, an analyst with Edmunds.com, said odds are slim the U.S. market finishes at last year’s level, particularly as interest rates start to rise and leasing growth stalls.

“Last year, it seemed like ‘Oh, there’s still probably room for it to grow, all the other metrics look good,”’ Caldwell said. “But this month it seems like things are pointing to a slowdown.”

No New Plants

While industry sales probably won’t fall by much -- they’re down 1.5 percent through March -- profits could slip as automakers cut production. Trump will have a hard time getting the new investment he’s been demanding, even with consumer confidence strong and unemployment low.

“You’re not going to see the U.S. get new plants,” Mark Wakefield, who heads the automotive practice for consulting firm Alix Partners, said by phone. “The market went from pull to push nine months ago. We don’t see it going upward from here.”

GM has already made cuts since late last year at passenger car plants in Michigan and Ohio, laying off more than 3,000 workers who build Chevy Cruze compacts and Impala sedans. Ford in January canceled plans to build a $1.6 billion factory in Mexico, after deciding it didn’t need to boost output of Focus compacts.

Wakefield projects sales will slip by about 300,000 units this year, as a typical cyclical decline of 15 percent to 20 percent begins.

“When it drops, it drops sharply,” he said. “It doesn’t fade down.”"
2017-04-03 00:00:00,"Musk Trolls Shorts as Tesla's Value Hits Record, Passes Ford","Tesla Inc.’s Elon Musk poked fun at short sellers as his electric-car maker’s stock surged to a record, vaulting its market value past century-old rival Ford Motor Co.

“Stormy weather in Shortville...” the chief executive officer tweeted Monday, as Tesla shares climbed as much as 5.8 percent. The maker of Model S sedans and Model X crossovers saw its capitalization surge to about $48.2 billion, $3.1 billion more than Ford, the No. 2 automaker in the U.S. after General Motors Co.

Stormy weather in Shortville ... — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) April 3, 2017

Tesla has long been a popular target by short sellers such as Jim Chanos, who famously bet early on energy company Enron Corp.’s failure -- and was proved right. Short interest in Tesla has risen to 29 percent of its free float from a 52-week low of 20 percent in mid-October, according to Markit data.

Tesla’s move past Ford came one day after Musk’s company reported worldwide shipments of 25,000 cars and SUVs in the first quarter, exceeding analysts’ estimates. While Ford delivered about nine times as many vehicles in just the U.S. last month, its sales missed projections and the shares fell.

“I don’t know if people want electric cars, but people want Tesla,” said Ben Kallo, an analyst at Robert W. Baird & Co. “I’m not an Elon Musk worshiper, but people that would normally buy a Porsche are buying Teslas right now.”





Ford, which reported net income over the last five years totaling $26 billion, towers over Tesla on most metrics. Tesla lost $2.3 billion during the same five-year span. Revenue was $151.8 billion last year for Ford, compared with Tesla’s $7 billion.

Tesla sold about 40,697 vehicles in the U.S. last year, according to registration data compiled by IHS Markit. Ford delivers that many F-Series trucks about every three weeks.

‘Star Power’

But Tesla has long been valued like a technology stock, in part because of what Kallo called Musk’s “star power.” Also the CEO of rocket manufacturer SpaceX, which has grand plans to colonize Mars, Musk has demonstrated his pull on Wall Street. He’s raised about $8 billion from equity and debt offerings since 2010, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

Kallo is convinced Tesla has the ability to achieve its ambitious goals.

“They’re a better car manufacturer, they attract better talent and they have more things going on beyond their four walls than we know about,” he said. “Worn-out industries where people don’t make money is the opportunity for companies like Tesla.”

The Palo Alto, California-based company has yet to prove it can manufacture in high volumes. Tesla’s brand ranked No. 30 in the U.S. in terms of sales last year, according to researcher Autodata Corp.

But investors are looking far ahead to the Model 3, a sedan that will retail for about $35,000, compared with $68,000 for the least-expensive Tesla available now. Musk has predicted that with Model 3 in the lineup, the company’s annual production will ramp up to 500,000 by 2018.

Tencent Stake

Among the believers is Chinese Internet giant Tencent Holdings Ltd., which bought a 5 percent stake in Tesla in March, giving Musk a key adviser as he tries to crack the world’s largest auto market.

“The only thing that matters for the stock this year is Model 3,” said Joseph Fath, a fund manager at T. Rowe Price, Tesla’s fourth-largest shareholder.

As Tesla tries to crack the mass market, the company will start to look more like a conventional carmaker and will have a tougher time justifying its value, said Maryann Keller, an auto industry consultant in Stamford, Connecticut.

As sales grow and Musk pushes beyond luxury buyers, he’ll have to add factories, retailers and staff to service cars. Plus, Keller said, there hasn’t been much demand so far for mass-market electric cars.

Day of Reckoning

“This is still the auto industry,” she said. “It’s highly competitive and he will have to add plants and people just like GM and Ford do. There will be a day of reckoning at some point.”

Dozens of other companies around the world have battery-powered cars on the market, and more are in development. Investors “act as if Tesla has some sort of patented product that cannot be replicated,” said Dave Sullivan, an analyst at researcher AutoPacific Inc.

“By the end of this decade, there’s going to be some significant choice for consumers looking for an electric vehicle,” he said, calling Tesla’s valuation outpacing Ford’s “mind boggling.”

Ford, which is planning to spend $4.5 billion expanding its fleet of electrified vehicles by 2020, is getting an intimate look at what it’s up against. A year ago, the company paid $199,950 -- $55,000 more than the sticker price -- to buy one of Tesla’s first Model X SUVs for internal testing."
2017-04-03 00:00:00,Former Google Vice President Starts a Company Promising Clean and Safe Nuclear Energy,"Hi folks, it’s Brad with the latest edition of the Fully Charged newsletter (sign up here). Last week was a rather grim one for Silicon Valley’s fervent community of environmentalists and clean energy advocates. With the sweep of a single executive order, President Donald Trump unwound the Obama-era framework of regulations designed to combat climate change and announced that he was “putting an end to the war on coal.”

But not everyone in high-tech is ready to return to the age of fossil fuels. Mike Cassidy, who was formerly vice president at Alphabet's X research lab and headed Project Loon, its high-altitude balloon-based internet access initiative, is ready to try the nuclear option.

Though Cassidy remains an advisor at Google, he has quietly started a new company, Apollo Fusion. On Friday, a website for the firm, which previously consisted only of a definition of the phrase “nuclear fusion,” was updated to include a vision statement that gives a tantalizing peek into Cassidy's plans.

“We're working on revolutionary hybrid reactor technology with fusion power to serve safe, clean, and affordable electricity to everyone,” reads the site. “Apollo Fusion power plants are designed for zero-consequence outcomes to loss of cooling or loss of control scenarios and they cannot melt down.”

The website asserts that Apollo Fusion's reactors will be inexpensive to build, cost competitive with traditional means of generating electricity, and flexible enough to serve both small villages and large cities. It says Cassidy is working with Ben Longmier, the founder of a company called Aether Industries, which made equipment for high-altitude research and was acquired by Apple in 2015. Longmier also has a PhD in plasma physics and advanced degrees in physics and nuclear engineering.

When contacted last week about the new venture, Cassidy was spare with details of the company’s plans though not with his pointed views on clean energy and the environment.

“I believe that global warming is real and I believe we are just dumping tons and tons of CO2 into our atmosphere that is heating up the globe,” says Cassidy, who started and sold four separate technology startups over the past 20 years, including an instant messaging service for gamers, a search engine and an online travel site Ruba, which Google acquired in 2010. “Environmentalists have struggled for a while over whether nuclear power is good or bad. I think most of the more thoughtful environmentalists now view nuclear as good. If you can find a way to do nuclear power that doesn't have the downsides, the risky, runaway meltdowns, or things like that, it's a real win for the planet.”

Only a few nuclear power plants have been constructed in North America over the last few decades, as politicians and communities worried about accidents like Fukushima and 3 Mile Island and the implications of terrorist attacks like 9/11 aimed at nuclear facilities. Apollo Fusion’s technology appears to be designed to assuage those fears. It’s developing a “subcritical hybrid reactor”—a fusion-fission reactor that doesn't a achieve sustained nuclear reaction and that draws neutrons from other sources, such as deuterium, an isotope that has an extra neutron and can be distilled from water.

Cassidy is starting Apollo Fusion outside of Alphabet. Although he says founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin are “super enthusiastic,” they are not investors, and he declined to say who is backing the company. The website also says Apollo already has “an agreement to deliver power to our first international customer.”

Apollo Fusion isn't the only startup trying to safely harness the powerful nuclear fusion reactions that occur in stars. Helion Energy, based in Redmond, Washington, took an investment from the startup accelerator Y Combinator and Peter Thiel's Mithril Capital Management in 2014. It's developing a truck sized fusion reactor using pulsed magnetic fields and deuterium extracted from water. GeneralFusion, based near Vancouver, Canada, has the backing of Amazon’s Jeff Bezos, while TriAlpha Energy, which bills itself as the “world’s largest private fusion company,” has raised $500 million from Goldman Sachs and Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen.

2017-03-30 00:00:00,The 22-Year-Old at the Center of the Self-Driving Car Craze,"In the sixth grade, Austin Russell turned a Nintendo gaming handset into a cell phone. At 15, he built a holographic keyboard. By 17, he’d filed for a patent. Now at 22, he’s running a startup at the heart of Silicon Valley’s latest technology mania.

As founder and chief executive officer of Luminar Technologies Inc., Russell and his team are building lidar, a hyper-accurate laser sensing technology crucial for self-driving cars. Google parent Alphabet Inc. is suing Uber Technologies Inc. for allegedly stealing lidar designs, while startups Velodyne Lidar Inc. and Quanergy Systems Inc. have raised at least $150 million apiece from giants like Ford Motor Co., Baidu Inc., Daimler AG and Samsung Electronics Co.

Russell has raised a similar amount, according to people familiar with Luminar’s finances. The company, founded in 2012, had sought a valuation above $1 billion when it was raising money last year, one of the people said. It’s unclear who invested -- Luminar is in ""stealth"" mode, meaning it hasn’t announced itself to the world yet. A spokeswoman declined to comment, as did Russell’s father Michael, a commercial real estate veteran who serves as chief financial officer. A message sent to Austin Russell through his LinkedIn profile was answered by his assistant, who declined to comment.

Peter Thiel awarded Russell a $100,000 Thiel Fellowship when he was 17, letting him quit Stanford University. The billionaire venture capitalist is a regular visitor to a sprawling Portola Valley ranch, 40 miles south of San Francisco, where Luminar tinkers and tests lidar systems while employees and guests crash on the couch, according to someone who has been there. Car companies, including BMW AG and General Motors Co., have also dropped by.

When it was occupied by a previous tenant, the five-acre space was featured in a TechCrunch video showing a pool, trampoline, room for more than 20 people to live, and space for the world’s largest organ. The property, with sweeping views of San Francisco Bay, was listed a few years ago for $22,000 a month.

That a relatively unknown college dropout of barely drinking age can raise millions of dollars shows the appetite for lidar. “It’s a gold rush and we’re selling pickaxes,” said Velodyne President Mike Jellen, who graduated college years before Russell was born. Several car companies want autonomous vehicles on the road by 2020 or 2021, which means they’re starting to order lots of lidar systems. Velodyne expects to ship 12,000 units this year, 80,000 in 2018 and 1.7 million by 2022.

Luminar’s rise also says a lot about Silicon Valley’s past and present. It’s still the place where prodigies can find generous backers for audacious plans. The ideas used to be mobile apps or web software. Now, it’s increasingly technology that interacts with the physical world -- cars, robots, drones and software for automation. Russell is part of this new era.

In January, in the up-scale Nob Hill section of San Francisco, a gangling Russell attended a party for 1517 Fund, a VC firm partly backed by Thiel. Towering above the crowd, he lingered in the corner near the entrance, speaking in a booming voice, and avoiding eye contact with a reporter. He was mostly immersed in his phone, which he showed occasionally to a small group gathered close to him, while more than 100 up-and-coming entrepreneurs and older mentor types chomped pizza and sipped beer.

Some of Luminar’s money has been used to buy a small fleet of Tesla Model S electric cars, which it uses for testing, said one of the people who has visited. It’s also funding research and development to solve challenges that have plagued the nascent lidar market.

A top-of-the-range lidar from Velodyne sells for more than $50,000. It offers cheaper lidar, which generates lower-definition 3-D images, for about $8,000, while Quanergy has a product that sells for some $4,000. Autonomous cars often require two or more lidar sensors, so having a capable system can get expensive.

Russell is trying to develop a lidar priced significantly less than $1,000, according to people with knowledge of Luminar’s planning. Quanergy aims to have one that sells below $100 in three to four years.

Whereas radar uses radio waves to detect objects, lidar uses laser beams, helping it produce more accurate 3-D images. It’s an essential ingredient for autonomous driving because it generates a real-time image of passing and surrounding objects and helps a vehicle accurately locate itself. Satellite navigation systems are only accurate to within about 16 feet -- not enough for a driverless future.

In a recent demonstration, the images generated by Luminar’s lidar system were higher-definition than those produced by competing equipment made by Velodyne or Quanergy, according to someone who saw the equipment first-hand, but was not allowed to discuss it publicly. Another version generated even sharper images, but the information was processed with a slight delay -- because of a lack of computing power to crunch all the data rather than a problem with the core technology, the person said.

Luminar may have bigger plans. A trademark filing from June 30 described a ""vehicle collision avoidance system"" with ultrasound sensors and radar apparatus, not just the optical technology used in lidar. In recent weeks, it posted 19 jobs online, seeking engineers, attorneys, a ""Fiber Laser Production Manager"" and a vehicle integration specialist.

Russell has the ability and drive to make Luminar successful -- as long as he focuses his prodigious brain, according to Tony Jordan, his physics teacher at St. Margaret’s Episcopal School in San Juan Capistrano, about 50 miles south of Los Angeles.

“The kid’s mind is so broad that he literally always had 50 ideas going at one time,” Jordan said. “My only thought was if he ever slows down enough to see one idea all the way to completion.”

Russell showed early promise, working as a consultant software engineer at age 10, according to a 2014 interview posted on YouTube. A year later, when his parents refused to buy him a mobile phone, he hacked a Nintendo DS portable gaming console into a handset. In 2013, he filed a patent for a ""three-dimensional imager and projection device.""

His parents’ garage in Newport Beach, California, was the hub for his early inventions, said Jordan. “They had a hard time ever parking their cars in the garage because he had absconded with the Ping-Pong table and made that his lab table,” said Jordan, “That’s where some of his best thinking was done.” (He’s a fan of the sport too, attending the launch of a SPiN Ping-Pong social club in San Francisco’s SoMa neighborhood last year).

A 15-year-old Russell came to a school staff meeting one morning to demonstrate a system that beamed a holographic keyboard onto a table top and typed words. “That blew most people’s minds,” Jordan said. Other early inventions included a laser that could detect whether a mole was cancerous, and a theoretical framework to charge electrical devices by beaming energy down from satellites.

In June 2013, the Orange County Register named the then 17-year-old Russell a top graduate, noting his interest in photonics -- the use of electromagnetic energy -- and his plans to attend Stanford that fall. ""You should push yourself to the limit at least, ultimately,"" Russell told the newspaper. ""That’s what you have to do if you want to make an impact on the world.""

In 2014, Russell led Luminar in a digital health care competition sponsored by Qualcomm Inc. In a video about their entry, the young, mop-haired CEO described his lidar system and another technology called a ""real-time hyperspectral camera system"" that measures the molecular structure of objects well beyond what a human eye can see. Such cameras cost tens of thousands of dollars and were the size of a small fridge at the time. Russell said Luminar had built one as small as ""a few pennies.""

He exhibited a competitive streak in high school, where he led a robotics team to the national championships, Jordan recalled.

“You’ve never seen someone more upset when they lost, or the robot went down, or the person handling the robot mishandled one of the feats that they had to do to win,” said Jordan. “I really enjoyed watching someone who was usually so cool and so on nine different planes that you were never sure he was with you, he also had this single-minded focus and competitiveness.”

Russell will need those qualities because the window to make the most of the lidar business may be closing quickly. Current systems are too expensive for production cars, yet bringing prices below $100 may make it hard to generate significant profit.

“It’s going to go the same way as radar has and become commoditized,” said Sebastian Thrun, CEO of online learning specialist Udacity Inc. and the former head of Google’s driverless car project. “Radar used to be $60,000 apiece and now it’s like $80 apiece. There’s no reason lidar can’t cost $80 apiece.”"
2017-03-28 00:00:00,Why Kabila's Lingering Makes Congo Newly Perilous: QuickTake Q&A,"The Democratic Republic of Congo, the largest country in sub-Saharan Africa and a major producer of natural resources including copper, cobalt, gold and tin, has never had a peaceful transfer of power. The country has had just three leaders since 1965, and if President Joseph Kabila has his way, it won’t have a fourth any time soon. Kabila’s second term -- his last, according to the constitution -- ended Dec. 19, but he’s still in office. Under a Dec. 31 agreement between the government and opposition groups, Kabila can remain in power until overdue elections are held at the end of the year, but the implementation of the deal has stalled. The Kabila regime’s refusal to cede power has already led to a slowdown in policy making and economic activity. The economy is forecast to grow 4.2 percent this year, compared with an average of 7.2 percent over the past five years, according to the International Monetary Fund.

1. What does Kabila say?

The reclusive president, who rarely speaks in public, hasn’t commented on his own future. His advisers say he will hand over power after democratic elections. However, since Kabila’s re-election in 2011, his government has tried at least twice to introduce legal changes to prolong his time in office. In a rare public appearance four months before his current term expired, Kabila told reporters in Uganda that the organization of balloting was the responsibility of the national electoral commission, which first needed to update the country’s voter rolls. Since July, 19 million people have been enrolled out of an estimated 41 million voters.

2. What is Kabila’s record?

Kabila inherited the presidency in 2001 at the age of 29 upon the assassination of his father, a rebel leader who had taken power three years earlier. Despite his youth, Kabila brought an end to the civil war in 2003 and has overseen a period of economic growth, driven by high mineral prices and the revival of Congo’s mining industry. Congo is now Africa’s biggest producer of copper and the world’s largest source of cobalt. Stability attracted foreign mining giants such as Glencore Plc and Freeport-McMoRan Inc. Gross domestic product has quadrupled since the end of the war. Still, low-level conflict has continued to plague communities in the east of the country, and nearly two-thirds of Congo’s 77 million people live on less than $1.90 a day. Infrastructure remains dilapidated, access to electricity is limited and basic health-care is lacking. And in the past two years, Kabila’s security forces have sought to silence critics, killing at least 98 people in September and December in protests featuring calls on the president to step down.

3. What does the opposition want?

Originally, Congo’s opposition leaders demanded that Kabila leave power last December, even if no elections were held. Eventually, they agreed to the Dec. 31 compromise brokered by the country’s powerful Catholic Church to avoid further violence. Under the deal, opposition leaders agreed that Kabila could stay if he organized elections before the end of 2017 and appointed a new power-sharing government headed by an opposition prime minister to function in the meantime.

4. So what’s the problem?

Kabila has yet to appoint that government, and no clear effort has been made to accelerate election preparations. The December agreement included a commitment from the ruling coalition that the president wouldn’t change the constitution to allow himself a third presidential term. But Kabila didn’t sign the agreement, and opposition leaders fear the president plans to hold on to power either by delaying the vote indefinitely or by creating a pretext to change the rules.

5. Is the opposition united?

Not especially. Congo’s opposition is large, but fractured. Opposition efforts to unify in order to sustain pressure on Kabila were set back in February by the death at age 84 of Etienne Tshisekedi, who had been at the forefront of opposition politics for more than three decades. His symbolic leadership had bound together the disparate group of opposition radicals and former ruling party members who signed the December deal. Weeks of infighting after Tshisekedi’s death cost the opposition valuable time, although it eventually coalesced behind his son, Felix, and rejoined talks on the implementation of the December deal.

6. What’s at stake for Kabila?

If Kabila were to step down now, he could be heralded as the father of Congolese democracy by enabling the country’s first peaceful transfer of power. On the other hand, he may want to stay on to preserve and protect the international business empire he and his family have built. A Bloomberg News investigation in December found that since 2001, Kabila, his wife, two children and eight of his siblings had stakes or directorships in at least 70 companies that generate hundreds of millions of dollars for the family. The norm in the region doesn’t encourage Kabila to step down. Among the nine countries bordering Congo, four have leaders that have been in power for 19 years or longer and have found ways to circumvent or change constitutionally imposed term limits.

7. What’s at stake for Congo?

Fragile investor confidence in Congo has been damaged by the uncertainty. S&P Global Ratings lowered Congo’s investment outlook last year to negative, citing growing political tensions. Commercial operators say predation by Congo’s cash-starved government agencies has become a daily occurrence. The government expects resurgent copper and cobalt prices to help revive economic growth this year, but there would be a lag before government revenue would be impacted. Meanwhile, the population will bear the brunt of rising inflation and a depreciating local currency. Should Kabila find an excuse to break the December deal, the opposition is apt to call new protests, which would likely be met with a harsh response. With a resurgence of militia activity in parts of eastern Congo and new fighting in the Kasai-Central province having already spread to five provinces, renewed urban protests would test Kabila’s ability to maintain control of the country. Regional players are less inclined to meddle in Congolese security than they were 20 years ago, so a new civil war is unlikely. Still, the uncertainty around when and how Kabila will leave office will continue to stoke conflict and check investment until he steps down.

2017-03-24 00:00:00,Tesla Will Take Orders for Its Solar Roof in April,"Tesla Inc. is ready to start taking deposits for its stunning solar roof tiles.

The company will begin taking orders next month, Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk said via Twitter on Friday. Tesla hasn’t disclosed detailed pricing on the tiles, but that would presumably become clear when people start putting down deposits. Installations will begin in mid 2017, according to the company’s website.

The roof tiles are made of textured glass. From most viewing angles, they look just like ordinary shingles, but they allow light to pass through from above onto a standard flat solar cell. The plan is for Panasonic Corp. to produce the solar cells at Tesla’s factory in Buffalo and for Tesla to put together the glass tiles and everything that goes along with them.

After Tesla acquired SolarCity in November, Musk said Tesla’s new solar roof product will actually cost less to manufacture and install than a traditional roof—even before savings from the power bill. “Electricity,” Musk said, “is just a bonus.”

Still, the solar tiles are likely to be a premium product: The terra cotta and slate roofs Tesla mimicked are among the most expensive roofing materials on the market—costing as much as 20 times more than cheap asphalt shingles.

The company has been generating a ""waiting list"" of people who might be interested in the glass solar tiles since the product was unveiled in October. The wait may soon be over.
